* {connector-name} - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis.
* {version} - Connector version. For example, 1.0.
* {lc-connector-name} - Lower case connector name to use in the links in the Next Steps and See Also sections. For example, redis.
* {studio-connector-name} - Name of the connector as it appears in the Available modules section in the Studio Add Dependencies to Project window. For example, NetSuite Connector - Mule 4.

=== Configure Attributes for the On Table Row Source

The *On Table Row* source selects from a table at a regular interval and generates one message per obtained row. 

. Add the *On Table Row* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On Table Row* component on the canvas. 
. In the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description 
| Table | Name of the database table to select from.
| Watermark column | (Optional) Values taken from this column are used to filter the contents of the next poll, so that only rows with a greater watermark value are processed.
|Id column |Used in conjunction with *Watermark column*, which is the name of the column to consider as the row ID. If provided, this component ensures that the same row is not processed twice by concurrent polls.
|Scheduling strategy | Triggers execution of the flow based on a time-based condition. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-component-scheduler.adoc[]
|===

. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description 
|Transactional action | Type of joining action that operations can use in transactions.
| Transaction type |
| Primary node only |Select this option to execute the *On Table Row* trigger on the primary node only when running in a cluster.
| Redelivery policy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:database-documentation.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy].
| xref:database-documentation.adoc#bulkDelete#query-timeout[Query timeout]Query timeout | Minimum amount of time before the JDBC driver attempts to cancel a running statement. By default, no timeout (0) is used.
| Query timeout unit | Select the unit of time to use. The default is `SECONDS`. 
| Fetch size | Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a ResultSet. This property is required when streaming is `true`, in which case a default value of `10` is used.
|Max rows |
|Reconnection strategy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever].

=== Configure Attributes for the Bulk Delete Operation

This operation allows delete operations to execute at various times using different parameter bindings and a single database statement. 

. Add the *Bulk delete* operation to the canvas.
. Click the *Bulk delete* component on the canvas. 
. In the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description
| Input Parameters | Specifies a list of maps that contain the parameter names as keys and the value the parameter is bound to. 
| SQL Query Text |Text of the SQL query to execute.
