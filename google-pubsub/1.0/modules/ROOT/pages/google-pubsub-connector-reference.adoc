[[SeekMessages]]
== Seek Messages
`<pubsub:seek-messages>`


Supports bulk acknowledging or un-acknowledging of messages to given snapshot or point of time based on the seekTarget provided. Seeking to a time marks every message received by Pub/Sub before the time as acknowledged, and all messages received after the time as unacknowledged. That means that you can replay and reprocess previously acknowledged messages when seeking to a time in past or purge messages by seeking to a time in the future. NOTE: If you seek to a timestamp using a subscription with a filter, the Pub/Sub service only redelivers the messages that match the filter The snapshot feature allows you to capture the message acknowledgment state of a subscription. Once a snapshot is created, it retains: All messages that were unacknowledged in the source subscription at the time of the snapshot's creation. Any messages published to the topic thereafter. You can replay these unacknowledged messages by using a snapshot to seek to any of the topic's subscriptions. NOTE: If you seek to a snapshot using a subscription with a filter, the Pub/Sub service only redelivers the messages in the snapshot that match the filter of the subscription making the seek request.


=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Config Ref a| ConfigurationProvider |  The name of the configuration to be used to execute this component |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Project ID a| String |  A globally unique identifier for your project. |  | {nbsp}
| Subscription Name a| String |  A project-wide unique identifier for subscription. |  | {nbsp}
| Snapshot Name a| String |  The snapshot to seek to. The snapshot's topic must be the same as that of the provided subscription. |  | {nbsp}
| Timestamp a| DateTime |  The specific time to seek to. Messages retained in the subscription that were published before this time are marked as acknowledged, and messages retained in the subscription that were published after this time are marked as unacknowledged. Note that this operation affects only those messages retained in the subscription (configured by the combination of messageRetentionDuration and retainAckedMessages). For example, if time corresponds to a point before the message retention window (or to a point before the system's notion of the subscription creation time), only retained messages will be marked as unacknowledged, and already-expunged messages will not be restored. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z". |  | {nbsp}
