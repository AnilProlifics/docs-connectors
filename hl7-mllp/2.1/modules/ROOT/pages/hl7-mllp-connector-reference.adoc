[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener, MLLP Listener>>
| Connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x

|===

[[mllp-listener-config_mllp-listener]]
== MLLP Listener Connection Type

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Delimiter a| String |  Character code that separates MLLP messages. By default, MLLP uses `001C`. |  |x
| TLS Configuration a| <<TLS>> |  Uses SSLServerSocket instead of plain TCP ServerSocket for accepting new SSL connections. |  |
| Port a| Number |  Connection's port number. |  |x
| Host a| String |  Connection's host name. |  |x
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server.
 |  |
| Send Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer, in bytes, to use when sending data. This is a property on the socket, itself. |  |
| Receive Buffer Size a| Number |  Size of the buffer, in bytes, to use when receiving data. This property is set on the socket, itself. |  |
| Client Timeout a| Number |  SO_TIMEOUT value on sockets. Indicates the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the socket waits in a blocking operation before it fails. A value of `0` means that the socket waits indefinitely. | 0 |
| Reuse Address a| Boolean |  If set, SO_REUSEADDRESS is set on the sockets before binding. This helps reduce `address already in use` errors when a socket is reused. |  true |
| Send TCP With No Delay a| Boolean | If set, transmitted data is sent immediately instead of collected together for greater efficiency. This value defaults to `true` even though the socket default is false because optimizing to reduce amount of network traffic over latency is not usually a concern today. |  true |
| Linger a| Number |  SO_LINGER value, in milliseconds, which indicates how long the socket takes to close so that any remaining data is transmitted correctly. |  |
| Keep Alive a| Boolean | Enables SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open, but unused, for long periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable. This is a property on the socket itself and is used by a server socket to control whether connections to the server are kept alive before they are recycled. |  false |
| Fail On Unresolved Host a| Boolean |  Whether the socket fails during its creation if the host set on the endpoint can't be resolved. Set this value to `false` to allow unresolved hosts (useful when connecting through a proxy). |  true |
|Connection Count |Number | Number of connections accepted at one time. This  value can be an integer or DataWeave expression. An empty value, negative value, or value of `0` indicates that the connector can accept an unlimited number of connections. | |
| Server Timeout a| Number |  This sets the SO_TIMEOUT value when the socket is used as a server. This is the timeout that applies to the accept operation. A value of `0` (the ServerSocket default) causes the accept to wait indefinitely if no connection arrives. |  |
| Receive Backlog a| Number |  Maximum queue length for incoming connections. |  50 |

=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

Configures the in-memory streaming strategy by which the request fails if the data exceeds the MAX buffer size. Always run performance tests to find the optimal buffer size for your specific use case.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required

** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the <b>Initial Buffer Size</b>, <b>Buffer Size Increment</b>, and <b>Max Buffer Size>/b> fields. |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule runtime keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:

Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.

Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time.|  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the <b>In Memory Size</b> field. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow. 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the <b>Use Secure Hash<b/> field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload’s `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the <b>Use Secure Hash</b> field is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |
|===

[[SocketConnectionSettings]]
=== Socket Connection Settings

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Port a| Number | Connection's port number. |  | x
| Host a| String | Connection's host name. |  | x
|===

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which throws a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which  creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException is thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it blocks indefinitely. |  |
| Initialization Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized. The possible values are: INITIALISE_NONE (does not load any components into the pool on startup), INITIALISE_ONE (loads one initial component into the pool on startup), or INITIALISE_ALL (loads all components in the pool on startup). |  |
| Disabled a| Boolean | Whether pooling should be disabled. |  |
