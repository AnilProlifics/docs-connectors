[[Config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| * <<Config_BasicAuthentication, Basic Authentication>> {nbsp}
* <<Config_CertificateAuthentication, Certificate Authentication>> {nbsp}
* <<Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication, Oauth2 Client Credentials Authentication>> {nbsp}
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}

** WSA200508
** WSA200408 |  WS-Addressing version. Defaults to WSA 2005-08 |  WSA200508 | {nbsp}
| From a| String |  Reference of the endpoint where the message originated from. |  | {nbsp}
|===

==== Connection Types
[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
===== Basic Authentication


Basic Authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.


====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. From this base URL all other endpoints derive. |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Enables automatic service discovery. |  true | {nbsp}
| Discovery Service Path a| String |  URL which will be used for automatic services discovery. |  /sap/bc/srt/wsil_ext | {nbsp}
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. |   | {nbsp}
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services which will be added to the list of discovered services. |  | {nbsp}
| Service discovery resolution timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for service discovery. |  30 | {nbsp}
| Service Discovery Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Connection timeout unit for service discovery. |  SECONDS | {nbsp}
| Default HTTP headers a| Object |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  | {nbsp}
| Default query parameters a| Object |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  | {nbsp}
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  | {nbsp}
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config. |  | {nbsp}
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy |  | {nbsp}
|===
[[Config_CertificateAuthentication]]
===== Certificate Authentication


An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate based on the widely accepted International Telecommunications Union (ITU) X.509 standard, which defines the format of public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates. They are used to manage identity and security in internet communications and computer networking. Note: X509Authentication requires a DiscoveryServiceConfiguration, a valid certificate and a secure connection(HTTPS)

[[Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication]]
===== Oauth2 Client Credentials Authentication


OAuth2 Authentication handles the secure way of authentication against the resource using the provided clientId and clientSecret. Authentication is ensured using the generated access token by the resource. This token has a limited lifespan and it's automatically refreshed by initiating a refresh dance, after the token expires.
