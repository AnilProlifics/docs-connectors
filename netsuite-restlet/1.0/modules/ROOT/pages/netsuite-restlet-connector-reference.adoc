|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*
| Connection a| * <<RestConfig_RestletLogin, Restlet Login>>
* <<RestConfig_RestletToken, Restlet Token>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule purges the instances as appropriate. |  |

| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Defines a configuration for TLS, which can be used from both the client and server sides to secure communication for the Mule app. When using the HTTPS protocol, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS or SSL. If HTTPS is configured as the protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the `tls:context` child element of the `listener-config`. |  |
| Host a| String |  Hostname of the HTTP proxy, for example localhost. If used, you must also set the *Port* value. |  |

| Username a| String |  The username which should be supplied to the HTTP proxy on every request to NetSuite. This field is optional, since a user might want to pass through an unauthenticated HTTP proxy. |  |
| Password a| String |  The password which would be supplied to the HTTP proxy on every request to NetSuite. This field is optional, since a user might want to pass through an unauthenticated HTTP proxy. |  |
| E-mail a| String |  The login email of both NetSuite UI and SuiteTalk |  | *x*
| Password a| String |  The login password of both the NetSuite UI and SuiteTalk |  | *x*

[cols=".^20%,.^25%,.^30%,.^15%,.^10%", options="header"]
|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that may be active at one time. When maxActive is exceeded, the pool is said to be exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that may be idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and the exhaustedAction is set to WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL | Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted. Possible values are: "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL", which will throw a NoSuchElementException, "WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT", which will block by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available, or WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW, which will create a new Mule instance and return it, essentially making maxActive meaningless. If a positive maxWait value is supplied, it will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a NoSuchElementException will be thrown. If maxThreadWait is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized.

|======================
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | A scalar time value for the maximum amount of time a dynamic configuration instance should be allowed to be idle before it's considered eligible for expiration |  |
