= Start an App from a Browser
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-start-app-brows-task.adoc

In this procedure, you configure an HTTP Listener to specify a host name, port, and path. To listen on a specific port for every network interface on the server, set the host to `0.0.0.0`. Using `localhost` listens for incoming requests generated inside the server. Start a browser and submit a URL. The result appears in the Anypoint Studio Console.

. In Studio, create a new project by selecting *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. From the Mule Palette, drag an HTTP Listener to a new flow.
. Configure the Listener:
* Click plus (+) and ensure that *Host* is `0.0.0.0` and *Port* is `8081`, with no base path specified.
* In the properties editor, set *Path* to the URL to start the app from the browser. For example, set Path to `/trigger`.
* Accept the other default Listener settings, and save the configuration.
+
. From the Mule Palette, drag Core > Logger to the flow.
. In Logger, in *Message*, specify `Hello`.
+
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*. Ensure that the console messages state that the application started correctly by looking for the message `Mule is up and kicking`.
. Open a browser and type `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/trigger+`.
+
HTTP Listener hears the request on port 8081, and the app starts.
+
. In the Studio Console, scroll through the logs to see `Hello`.
