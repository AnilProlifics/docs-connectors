= Route HTTP Requests to Different Paths Example - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-conn-route-diff-paths-task.adoc

The following example illustrates multiple flows, each having an Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) *Listener* source that listens for requests to different subpaths:

* HTTP requests directed to `+http://localhost:8081/account+` are routed to the first flow.
* HTTP requests directed to `+http://localhost:8081/employee+` are routed to the second flow.
* When the HTTP Listener global element receives a request that doesnâ€™t match the path defined on any of the HTTP Listener, the connector returns an HTTP 404 (Resource Not Found) error.

To accomplish this example, you must create the Mule app, configure an HTTP global element, run, and test the app with curl commands.

The following screenshot shows the Anypoint Studio app flow for this example:

== Create the Mule Application

To create the Mule flow:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select the HTTP *Listener* source and drag it onto the canvas. +
The source initiates the flow by listening for incoming HTTP message attributes.
. Set the *Path* field to `account` to start the app from the web browser.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP *Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, configure the following fields:
+
* *Host*: `localhost`
* *Port*: `8081`
+
[start=5]
. Click *OK*.

.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the HTTP *Listener* source.
. To create the second flow, drag another HTTP *Listener* below the first flow.
. For the *Connector configuration* field, select the same `HTTP_Listener_config` configuration created for the first HTTP *Listener* source.
. Set the *Path* field to `employee`.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the second HTTP *Listener* source.

. In a client browser, go to the first URL: `+http://localhost:8081/account+`.
. In a client browser, go to the second URL: `+http://localhost:8081/employee+`.
. Verify that the logs show the requests routed to the first and then the second flows, respectively.
