= Post a Form - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::http/http-post-form-task.adoc

The following example shows how to post a form by sending HTTP requests. The example also illustrates how to send the resulting HTTP request, which contains form parameters, by using either an API client tool such as Postman or the `curl` command-line utility.

== Create an App with HTTP Listener Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. To create a new flow, add an HTTP Listener Connector to the canvas and set *Path* to `submitform`.
. Navigate to the *Global Elements* tab, and click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* filter box, search for and select the HTTP Listener configuration and click *OK*.
. Set *Host* to `localhost` and *Port* as the default value of `8081` and then click *OK*.
. Return to the message flow and, after the HTTP Connector, add a Choice router.
. On the first choice of the router, add a Set Payload element with the following value:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Sorry #[payload.'firstname'], you're too young to register.
----

+
Note that this expression refers to one of the form parameters included in the request: `firstname`. After the connector receives the parameter, it exists in the Mule Message payload as an item in a map
. On the Choice router, configure the *When* condition for that path as follows:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[server.dateTime.year-18 < payload.'yearborn']
----

+
Once again, this expression refers to one of the incoming form parameters, `yearborn`.
. Complete the flow by adding another Set Payload element in the *Default* path of the Choice router, with a payload value of:
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
Registration has been carried out successfully! Welcome #[payload.'firstname'] #[payload.'lastname']!
----

.Post Form Flow.

Once you create the flow, you can <<post-form,post a form by sending HTTP requests>>.

== Create an App with HTTP Listener Connector in XML Editor

. Create an `<http:listener>` global configuration and set *host* to `localhost` and *port* to `8081`.
. Create a flow with an `<http:listener>` connector. Reference your connector to the global element you just created, set *path* to `submitform`.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>

    <flow name="RegisterUser">
        <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="submitform" doc:name="HTTP"/>

    </flow>
----

. In the flow, after the HTTP Connector add a `choice` router with two alternative paths, in which the first path executes when the following MEL expression is true:
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']
----

+
Note that `yearborn` is one of the form parameters that is expected from incoming requests.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']">

            </when>
            <otherwise>

            </otherwise>
        </choice>
----

. Add a `set-payload` element on each alternative path, one to return a rejection notice and the other to return a success message. +
In both 'set-payload' elements, refer to the fields of the incoming form parameters to construct the message.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']">
                <set-payload value="Sorry #[payload.'firstname'], you're too young to register." doc:name="Too young"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise>
                <set-payload value="Registration has been carried out successfully! Welcome #[payload.'firstname'] #[payload.'lastname']!" doc:name="Success"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>
----

Once you create the flow, you can <<post-form,post a form by sending HTTP requests>>.

== Post a Form by Sending HTTP Requests
To post a form by sending HTTP requests, you can use an API client tool such as https://www.postman.com/product/api-client[Postman], or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.  If you use Postman, make sure you send the form parameters with content-type `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The following XML example expects to receive a POST request from: http://localhost:8081/submitform

// if you copy/paste the doc in the XML editor, change the left angle bracket to &lt;

The post body contains the following form parameters: `firstname`, `lastname` and `yearborn`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
POST /submitform HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mule/3.6
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 32

firstname=Aaron&lastname=Aguilar+Acevedo&yearborn=1999
----

When the HTTP Listener connector receives the request, it creates a Mule Message that contains a map type payload with the following key-value pairs:

`firstname: Aaron` +
`lastname: Aguilar Acevedo` +
`yearborn: 1999`

Note that in the case of the `lastname` parameter, while the value is encoded in the HTTP request (`Aguilar+Acevedo)`, the connector automatically decodes the value for you when placing it in the Mule Message.

On any of the remaining blocks on the flow, you can easily access the value of the elements in the Map payload by using MEL expressions to refer to their corresponding keys.

In the previous example, the value matching the `yearborn` key is obtained via the expression `#[payload.'yearborn']`. Depending on the value of this expression, one of two different paths is followed:

* The first path sets the payload to a message that rejects the registration, referencing the value matching the `firstname` key through a similar MEL expression.
* The second path accepts the registration and welcomes the user by name, referencing the `firstname` and `lastname` values.
