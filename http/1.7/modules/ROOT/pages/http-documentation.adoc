| Request Streaming Mode a| Enumeration, one of:
** AUTO
** ALWAYS
** NEVER |  Defines if the request should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior depends on the type of the payload (it will stream only for InputStream). If set to true, it will always stream. If set to false, it will never stream. As streaming is done the request is sent user Transfer-Encoding: chunked. |  AUTO |
| Enable Cookies a| Boolean |  If true, cookies received in HTTP responses will be stored, and sent in subsequent HTTP requests. |  true |
| Default Headers a| Array of <<defaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  |
| Query Parameters a| Array of <<QueryParam>> |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  |

Mule uses persistent connections.
* `false`
Mule closes the connection after the first request completes. |  true |
| Max Connections a| Number |  Maximum number of connections to open to the backend. HTTP requests are sent in parallel over multiple connections. Setting this value too high can impact latency and consume additional resources without increasing throughput. By default the number of connections is unlimited. |  -1 |
| Connection Idle Timeout a| Number |  The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled. |  30000 |

|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | Initial amount of memory to allocate to the data stream. If the streamed data exceeds this value, the buffer expands by *Buffer Size Increment*, with an upper limit of *Max In Memory Size value*. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | Maximum size of the buffer. If the buffer size exceeds this value, Mule raises a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error. A value of less than or equal to `0` means no limit. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

Configures the repeatable file-store streaming strategy by which Mule keeps a portion of the stream content in memory. If the stream content is larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer's content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Maximum amount of memory that the stream can use for data. If the amount of memory exceeds this value, Mule buffers the content to disk. To optimize performance:
* Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk. This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.
* Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:
** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | Unit for the *In Memory Size* field. |  |
|===

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  |
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  |
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  |
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  |
| Object Store a| Object Store | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  |
