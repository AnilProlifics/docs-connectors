Anypoint WSS Module enables you to process and validate an inbound SOAP request against a given Web Service Security (WSS) extension configuration to, for example, validate the request's signature, perform an LDAP authentication, or decrypt the inbound message. The WSS module also enables you to add a WSS header to your SOAP responses to sign the response, or to encrypt your outbound message.

For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see WSS Module Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The WSS Module's API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* How to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio

Before creating an app, you must have access to:

* The WSS Module target resource
* Anypoint Platform
* Anypoint Studio version 7.x or later
* Web Services Security (WSS) extension for SOAP.

== Common Use Cases For the Connector

The WSS module enables you to validate WSS headers in the inbound SOAP requests to your application to:

* Decrypt a SOAP envelope according to the encryption information.
* Verify a signature validity.
* Verify the freshness of the message by `timestamp` information.
* Verify `Username` and `Password` credentials of a `UsernameToken`.
* Verify `LDAP` credentials of a `UsernameToken`.
* Verify whether a `UsernameToken` has expired.
* Verify whether a `SAML Assertion` has expired.
* Verify the signature of a `SAML Assertion`.
* Verify a `SAML Assertion` has a specific confirmation method.

Using the WSS module you can also add WSS headers to your outbound SOAP response to:

* Encrypt the entire SOAP message content or only a part of it.
* Sign your SOAP message.

// == Using Exchange Templates and Examples
//
// https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange] provides templates
// that you can use as a starting point for your app, as well as examples that illustrate a complete solution.
//
// ////
// List and link to up to 10 Exchange templates and examples.
// Use the Integration Pattern categories (broadcast, migration, bidirectional sync, aggregation).
// ////

== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites and experiment with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app and configure the connector using xref:wss-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
