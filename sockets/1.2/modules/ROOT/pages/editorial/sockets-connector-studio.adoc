= Use Studio to Configure Sockets Connector 1.2 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure the Sockets Listener source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation, Configure the Send and Receive Operations in the flow>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the Supported TCP Protocols>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:sockets-documentation.adoc[Sockets Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Anypoint Connector for Sockets (Sockets Connector) to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* view, type `sockets` in the search field.
. Click *Sockets* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.


[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure the Sockets Listener Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. The Sockets Listener source represents a socket endpoint to which clients can connect. By browsing to this endpoint, external clients establish a TCP or UDP Socket connection and trigger the flow each time they send a message:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Sockets* > *Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `sockets listener` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, for *Connection* select the `Tcp listener` or the `Udp listener` connections.
. Configure the specific tabs for the selected connection:
+
[%header,cols=2]
|===
| Tab Name | Description
| *General* | Set the *Host* and the *Port* required attributes, and configure any other optional fields.
| *Buffer Configuration* | Optionally specify send and receive buffer size information.
| *TLS* | Optionally specify the TLS information.
| *Timeout Configuration* | Optionally specify the client and server timeout information.
| *Advanced* | Optionally specify the reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
|===

[start=7]
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

In Studio, the Sockets Listener source in the flow looks like this:

.Sockets Listener Source
image::socket-listener-source.png[Sockets Listener Source]

In Studio, configuring the Sockets Listener source with a TCP connection to accept local incoming connections on port `8082` looks like this:

.Sockets Listener Source Configuration
image::socket-listener-configuration.png[Sockets Listener Source Configuration]

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the XML looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
	<sockets:listener-config name="Sockets_Listener_config">
		<sockets:tcp-listener-connection host="localhost" port="8082" />
	</sockets:listener-config>

	<flow name="SocketsFlow" >
		<sockets:listene config-ref="Sockets_Listener_config"/>
	</flow>
----


== Configure the Send, and Send and Receive Operations

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform. Sockets Connector provides two basic operations:

 * Send +
 Sends the data using the client associated to the RequesterConnection.
 * Send and receive +
 Sends the data using the associated client and then blocks until a response is received or the timeout is met, in which case the operation returns a null payload.

To configure the Send, or Send and receive operations:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Sockets* > *Send*, or *Send and receive*.
. Drag the *Send* or the *Send and receive* operation to the Studio canvas.
. On the operation configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `Sockets Send` or `Sockets Send and receive` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, for *Connection* select the `Tcp requester` or the `Udp requester` connections.
. Configure the specific tabs for the selected connection:
+
[%header,cols=2]
|===
| Tab Name | Description
| *General* | Set the *Host* and the *Port* required attributes, and configure any other optional fields.
| *Buffer Configuration* | Optionally specify send and receive buffer size information.
| *Connection* | Optionally select and configure one of the supported TCP protocols.
| *Local Address Settings* | Optionally specify the local address.
| *TLS* | Optionally specify the TLS information.
| *Timeout Configuration* | Optionally specify the client and server timeout information.
| *Advanced* | Optionally specify the reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
|===

[start=7]
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

Additionally, for the *Send and receive* operation, configure the MIME Type as follows:

. Click the *Send and receive* operation from your flow.
. On the *MIME Type* tab, select a MIME type from the drop-down menu field.

In Studio, the Sockets Send operation and Send and receive operation in the flow look like this:

.Sockets Send and Receive Operation
image::socket-send-operation.png[Sockets Send and Receive operation]

In Studio, configuring either the Send operation or the Send and receive operation, with a TCP connection to accept local incoming connections on port `8082` looks like this:

.Sockets Send or Send and Receive Operation Configuration
image::socket-sendreceive-configuration.png[Sockets Send or Send and Receive operation Configuration]

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the Send operation configuration XML looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sockets:request-config name="Sockets_Send_config">
		<sockets:tcp-requester-connection host="localhost" port="8082" />
	</sockets:request-config>

	<flow name="SocketsFlow" >
		<sockets:send config-ref="Sockets_Send_config"/>
	</flow>
----

In Studio, configuring the MIME Type as `application/json` for the Send and receive operation looks like this:

.Sockets MIME Type Configuration
image::socket-mimetype-configuration.png[Sockets MIME type Configuration]

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the Send and receive operation configuration XML looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sockets:request-config name="Sockets_Send_config">
	<sockets:tcp-requester-connection host="localhost" port="8082" />
</sockets:request-config>

<flow name="SocketsFlow" >
	<sockets:send-and-receive config-ref="Sockets_Send_Receive_config" outputMimeType="application/json"/>
</flow>
----

== Configure the Supported TCP Protocols

Sockets Connector supports application-level protocols implemented on top of TCP. You must implement these protocols in both client and server ends so they can work properly. +
By default, the Sockets Connector implements the Safe Protocol; however, you can configure a different protocol for the connector operations both in Anypoint Studio and XML.

Supported TCP protocols:

* Direct Protocol +
  The socket reads until no more bytes are immediately available. On slow networks, `EOFProtocol` and `LengthProtocol` might be more reliable.
* EOF Protocol +
  Reading is terminated by the stream being closed by the client.
* Length Protocol +
  This protocol is defined by sending or reading an integer (the packet length) and then the data to transfer.
* Custom Class Loading Length Protocol +
  A length protocol that uses a specific class loader to load objects from streams.
* Safe Protocol +
  A test protocol that precedes every message with a cookie, and should not be used in production environments.
* Streaming Protocol +
  Allows the socket's Send operation to return a message with the original `InputStream` as payload.
* XML Message Protocol +
  Use this protocol to read streaming XML documents. The only requirement is that each document includes an XML declaration at the beginning of the document in the form  of `<?xml....`. +
  Data is read until a new document is found or until there is no more currently available data. For slower networks, `XmlMessageEofProtocol` might be more reliable. +
  Also, because the default character encoding for the platform is used to decode the message bytes when looking for the XML declaration, some caution with message character encodings is warranted.
* XML Message EOF Protocol +
  Extends `XmlMessageProtocol` to continue reading until either a new message or EOF is found.
* Custom Protocol +
  Define your own custom protocol by writing a class that extends `TcpProtocol`.

=== Configure TCP Protocols for the Sockets Listener

To configure supported TCP protocols for the Sockets Listener:

. Open the *Global Element Properties* configuration of the Sockets Listener.
. On the *General* tab, for *Connection* select  the `Tcp listener`.
. On the *General* section of the *General* tab, for *Protocol*, select one of the supported protocols.
. Set the required fields for the connector.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

In Studio, configuring the Sockets Listener to use Direct Protocol looks as follows:

.Sockets Direct Protocol Configuration
image::socket-tcp1-configuration.png[Sockets Direct Protocol Configuration]

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the XML looks as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
	<sockets:listener-config name="Sockets_Listener_config" >
		<sockets:tcp-listener-connection host="localhost" port="8082" >
			<sockets:protocol>
				<sockets:direct-protocol />
			</sockets:protocol>
		</sockets:tcp-listener-connection>
	</sockets:listener-config>
----

=== Configure TCP Protocols for Send and Receive Operations

To configure supported TCP protocols for either the Send operation or the Send and receive operation:

. Open the *Global Element Properties* configuration of your Sockets operation.
. On the *General* tab, for *Connection* select `Tcp requester`.
. On the *Connection* tab, for *Protocol* select one of the supported protocols.
. Set the required fields for the connector.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

In Studio, configuring the Send operation to use Direct Protocol, looks as follows:

.Sockets Direct Protocol Configuration
image::socket-tcp2-configuration.png[Sockets Direct Protocol Configuration]

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the XML looks as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sockets:request-config name="Sockets_Send_config" >
	<sockets:tcp-requester-connection >
		<sockets:protocol >
			<sockets:direct-protocol />
		</sockets:protocol>
	</sockets:tcp-requester-connection>
</sockets:request-config>
----

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.
