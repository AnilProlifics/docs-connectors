= Write a File Using the FTP Connector Example - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::ftp/ftp-write.adoc

The Anypoint Connector for FTP (FTP Connector) *Write* operation writes content into the given path on demand.

== Configure the Write Operation in Studio

To add and configure the *Write* operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for `ftp` and select *Write*.

. Drag the Write operation onto the Studio canvas.

. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (+) next to *Connector configuration* to access the global element configuration fields.

. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.

. In the *General* tab, set the Path field to `output.csv` to set the path of the file to write.
  By default, the connector writes whatever is in the message payload.

The following screenshot shows the *Write* operation configuration:

In the XML editor, the `<ftp:write>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:write path="output.csv" />
----

== Use Embedded DataWeave Transformations

If you place a *Transform Message* component before a *Write* operation, the message payload changes, and that impacts the operation that is placed after the *Write* operation. Therefore, if the payload is in a different format and you need to transform it before writing it, you can place the transformation inside *Content* in the *Write* configuration to generate the content to be written without affecting the message in transit.

The following example places the *DataWeave* transformation in *Content*:

In the XML editor, the configuration looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:write path="output.csv">
  <ftp:content>#[%dw 2.0
                   output application/csv
                   ---
                   payload.customers.email
                  ]
  </ftp:content>
</ftp:write>
----


== Write into a Directory

The *Write* operation fails by default if you set nonexistent directories in *Path*. Set *Create parent directories* to *True (Default)* to automatically create any missing directories.

In the following example, if any of the `a`, `b`, or `c` directories set in *Path* do not exist, the connector creates them:

In the XML editor, the configuration looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<ftp:write path="a/b/c/myFile.txt" />
