= Tracing Module 1.1 Reference

Tracing module enables you to enhance your logs by adding, removing, and clearing variables from the logging context for a given Mule event. It also enables you to modify the correlation ID during flow execution.

== Configurations

Default configuration


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x

== Operations

[[clear-logging]]
=== Clear Logging Variables
`<clear-logging-variables>`

Clears all the logging variables from the event logging context. This operation does not remove the correlation ID nor the current event processor because those variables are managed by Mule runtime engine.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name | String | Display name for the operation  | |
|===

[[remove-logging]]
=== Remove Logging Variables
`<remove-logging-variable>`

Removes a variable from the event logging context.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name | String | Display name for the operation. | |
| Variable name | String | Name of the variable to remove.  | x |
|===


[[set-logging]]
=== Set Logging Variables
`<set-logging-variable>`

Sets a new logging variable and its value. The new variable is present in the next operation execution for the event.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name | String | Display name for the operation. | |
| Variable name | String | Name of the variable to log.  | x |
| Value | String | Value to assign to the variable. Accepts DataWeave expressions.  | x |
|===

== Scopes

[[with-correlationID]]
=== With CorrelationID
`<with-correlation-id>`

Scope that creates a process where the inner chain modifies the current correlation ID in the event flow. After the process finishes its execution, the correlation ID returns to the previous ID.

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Name | String | Display name for the scope  | |
| Correlation id | String | Set a custom correlation ID. | x |
| Target Variable | String |  Name of the variable that stores the operation's output. |  |
| Target Value | String |  Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable.|  #[payload] |
