<li>Configure a larger buffer size to avoid the number of times Mule needs to write the buffer on disk.
<p>
This increases performance, but it also limits the number of concurrent requests your application can process, because it requires additional memory.
<li>Configure a smaller buffer size to decrease memory load at the expense of response time.
