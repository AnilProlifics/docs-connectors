= Consume AMQP Messages - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::amqp/amqp-consume.adoc


The `consume` operation in AMQP Connector provides the ability to consume a message at any given time in the flow, from any given AMQP queue.

== Consume a Message

The syntax to consume a message from a queue is:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:consume config-ref="AMQP_config" queueName="#[vars.queue]"/>
----

This operation consumes the first available message in the queue identified by the `queueName` value, and converts it to an `AmqpMessage`, which results in the following structure:

* The message's content as payload
* The message's metadata in the message attributes

After it is received, the message is immediately acknowledged by default. If you want to control the ACK of the message after some processing, then set `ackMode` to `MANUAL`.
For more information about message ACK operations, see xref:amqp-ack.adoc[How to Handle Acknowledgment].

== Default Config for Consume Operation

The default AMQP Config element has not the suitable parameters for the Consume operation since it's optimized for the Listen operation (the most used one).

In some environments, using the default Config with the Consume operation can present the following Error:

[source,xml,linenums]

This is because usually the broker sends all the messages the queue has to the requester but the Consume operation only processes the first one and ditches the rest. To avoid this use one of the following parameters change (or both, if applicable to your use case):

* Clean the property `maximumWait` (leave it empty)
* Set the property `prefetchCount` of section `quality-of-service-config` in the AMQP Config to `1`

== Wait for a Message

By default, the maximum wait time is configured to 10 seconds. If no message is available during the specified wait time, an `AMQP:TIMEOUT` error is thrown. You can customize the wait time by configuring the `maximumWait` and `maximumWaitUnit` parameters.

To create an indefinite wait time for a message to arrive, set the `maximumWait` value to `-1`. In this case, no `TIMEOUT` error is thrown.

== MIME Types and Encoding

AMQP Connector is designed to auto-determine a message’s MIME type (`contentType`) based on the `contentType` property of the message. However, there are cases in which it cannot make this determination, and you need firsthand knowledge of the message’s content.

In such cases, you can force the content type to a particular value by using the `contentType` parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that the default encoding of Mule runtime engine matches that of the message, if no other information is provided. You can set this by using the `encoding` parameter.

== Declare a Queue in the Consume Operation

By default, the `consume` operation fails with an `AMQP:QUEUE_NOT_FOUND` error if the defined queue does not exist.

If a queue must be declared, a definition for the entity should be referenced or defined inline:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:consume config-ref="Amqp_Config" queueName="testQueue">
	<amqp:fallback-queue-definition removalStrategy="SHUTDOWN" exchangeToBind="exchangeToBindToQueue" />
</amqp:consume>
----

Notice that in the definition of the queue a binding can be created using the parameter `exchangeToBind`.

The queue can also be defined as a high level element:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<amqp:queue-definition
	name="targetQueueDefinition"
	exchangeToBind="testExchange" />

<amqp:consume
	config-ref="AMQP_Config"
	queueName="testQueue"
	fallbackQueueDefinition="targetQueueDefinition">
----

== Avoid Changing the AMQP Topography

You can set the `createFallbackQueue` global config to prevent changes to the AMQP topography resulting from the definition of fallback queues, see xref:amqp-topography.adoc[How to Avoid Changing the AMQP Topography].

== Incoming Message Metadata

As stated earlier, each message received consists of two parts:

* The payload, containing the content of the message
* The attributes, containing metadata regarding the message

This metadata has four parts that map all the information available in a AMQP Message:

* Envelope
* AckId
* Headers
* Properties

See the xref:amqp-documentation.adoc[AMQP Reference] for information on the structure for attributes.
