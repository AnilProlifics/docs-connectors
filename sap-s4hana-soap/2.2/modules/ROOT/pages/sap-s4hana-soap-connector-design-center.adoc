:page-aliases: connectors::sap/sap-s4hana-soap-connector-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Design Center's Flow Designer enables you to create apps
visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Flow Designer field values, see
the xref:sap-s4hana-soap-connector-reference.adoc[SAP S/4HANA for SOAP Reference].


== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click the trigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector;
otherwise, you can use HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete these fields for a basic authentication connection type:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Service Base URL*| Base URL of the SAP S/4HANA instance you want to manage, for example: `mydomain.s4hana.ondemand.com`.
|*Username*| SAP S/4HANA username.
|*Password*| SAP S/4HANA password.
|===
+
. Click the *Test* button to test the connection.

Flow Designer automatically saves all changes.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the SAP S/4HANA SOAP Connector.
. Select the connector name.
. Select the Invoke operation for the connector.
. Complete these fields:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Service Name*| The name of the SOAP service to invoke.
|*Operation*| Operation to execute on the SOAP service.
|===
+
. The list of services and operations in the dropdown is automatically populated through auto-discovery of enabled SOAP APIs.
. Click the *Test* button to test the connection.

== Configure the Outbound Message Listener as the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click the trigger card.
. Search for the SAP S/4HANA SOAP Connector.
. Complete these fields in order to listen for outbound messages:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|*HTTP Listener*| Reference to a global HTTPS Listener configuration, for example: `HTTPS_Listener_config`.
 This configuration has to be secured by using **HTTPS protocol** in order to receive outbound messages from the SAP S/4HANA.
|*WSDL Paths*| Specify the paths to the WSDL definitions which will be used for resolving the metadata keys.
|*Encoding*| Character encoding used in the messaging.
|===
+
. Specify the path where source will listen for the outbound messages.
. Select the outbound message type which should source listen to.

Flow Designer automatically saves all changes.

**NOTE**

It is possible to share the same path between multiple sources, however, having multiple sources sharing the same path and listening to the same message type is not supported. The list of message types specifies message types the source can listen to. Message types are built from the provided WSDL definitions. There is a message type option **ANY**, which is always present and allows the source to listen to any outbound message type sent from SAP S/4HANA.
