= AS2 Connector 6.0 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::as2/as2-connectorMule4.adoc

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Premium]

Mule runtime engine (Mule) supports the AS2 protocol through Anypoint Connector for AS2 (AS2 Connector).

The AS2 Connector enables trading partners to transmit and receive AS2 messages with EDI-X12, EDIFACT, XML, or binary payloads. For example:

* Send messages, signed or unsigned, over HTTP or HTTPS, following the AS2 protocol

* Receive messages, also over HTTP or HTTPS, following the AS2 protocol

* Receive asynchronous MDN for the message sent

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the AS2 Connector Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* The AS2 target resource
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* How to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to:

* The AS2 target resource
* Anypoint Studio version 7.6 or later

=== Considerations when Migrating from the AS2 connector 5.x

AS2 Connector 6.0.0 requires Mule 4.3.0 or later. Refer to xref:as2-connector-upgrade-migrate.adoc[Upgrade and Migrate] for more information.

== Common Use Cases For the Connector

* Send with sync MDN

Sends a message through HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol requesting the partner for a synchronous MDN (receipt).

* Send with async MDN

Sends a message through HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol requesting the partner for an asynchronous MDN (receipt).

* Listener

Source that receives messages via HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol.

* MDN Listener

Source that receives asynchronous MDN receipts via HTTP or HTTPS using the AS2 protocol.

* Non repudiation Listener

Source that receives a signed copy of a receipt or a message for persistently storing it for the non-repudiation.

== Non-Repudiation Storage of AS2 messages and MDNs

If needed, you can configure non-repudiation storage for your AS2 operations to support regulatory or compliance requirements.

The following prerequisites are for enabling non-repudiation of a message in an AS2 connector:

* Only signed messages and MDNs are eligible for non-repudiation.

* Users must implement and configure a separate Mule flow that acts as a non-repudiation flow.

* This flow has access to the signed mime message that is passed to it along with appropriate non-repudiation specific attributes.

* It is this non-repudiation specific Mule flowâ€™s responsibility to take, store and act upon the message and attributes it receives.

* The name of this non-repudiation flow must be configured on an appropriate listener or operation that has the non-repudiation enabled.

Following sources and operations of AS2 connectors can have Non-Repudiation feature enabled in version 6.

* AS2 Send Sync Operation

* AS2 Send Async Operation

* AS2 Listener

* AS2 MDN Listener

== Audience

* New users, read:
