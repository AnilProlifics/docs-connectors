= MQTT 3 Connector 1.0

Support Category: https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/versioning-back-support-policy#anypoint-connectors[Select]

Anypoint Connector for MQTT 3 (MQTT 3 Connector) is an MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) version 3.x protocol compliant MuleSoft extension. MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas.

The connector consumes and produces MQTT messages and supports all MQTT v3.x functionalities including message retention, last will and testament messages, and persistent sessions.

For compatibility information and fixed issues, see the MQTT 3 Connector Release Notes.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* MQTT v3.x protocol
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.

== Common Use Cases for Connector

These are some common use cases for MQTT 3 Connector:

* Connect to MQTT brokers by specifying a failover server list that the client iterates over until a connection is successfully established.
* Connect to MQTT brokers in reliable messaging schema and publish messages.
* Connect to an MQTT broker and set a last will and testament (LWT) message to notify all the subscribers of the client’s disconnection.
* Connect to an MQTT broker with TLS and listen for messages.
* Listen for messages on a unique or multiple topics.
* Listen for messages on multiple topics using single-level or multi-level wildcards.
* Publish messages to a topic.
* Publish messages with retention.
* Publish messages to an MQTT topic and set different Quality of Service (QoS) levels of delivery assurance for inbound or outbound messages.


== MQTT Architecture
MQTT uses the publish/subscribe model, where a client publishes messages to a particular address, known as `Topic`. Client receivers subscribe to such topic and receive the published message. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber is aware of each other. The connection between the publisher and subscriber is managed by an MQTT broker.

=== MQTT Client
A MQTT Client is any device that runs an MQTT library and connects to an MQTT server over a network.

=== MQTT Broker
The MQTT Broker is a server that receives messages from the clients and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients.

=== MQTT Topic
As the broker acts as a post office, MQTT doesn’t use the address of the intended recipient but uses the subject line called `Topic`, and anyone who wants a copy of that message subscribes to that topic. Multiple clients can receive the message from a single broker (one to many).

== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create your own app and configure the connector using xref:mqtt3-connector-studio-configuration.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
