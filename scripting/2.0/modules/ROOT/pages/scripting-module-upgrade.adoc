== Supported Upgrade Paths

[%header,cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|From Version | To Version
|1.1.7 |2.0.0
|===

== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Scripting Module no longer provides default scripting engines:
** Use a new *Configure...* helper button to install your desired engines.
** Specify the desired engine in the `pom.xml` file of your application.
* For any data stream provided in the payload or variables, a cursor object opens and binds, preventing the need for you to open new cursors. Any `openCursor()` provided to the Scripting Module closes after the script execution.


== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must complete the following:

* Create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter  in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select `Scripting Module` and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-scripting-module` dependency version is `2.0.0` in the file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, add a `jsr-223` compliant scripting engine:

. In Anypoint Studio, navigate to the *Execute* tab operation of your application.
. In *Required Libraries* section, click *Configure...* and select one of the following options to search your desired engine: +

* Add recommended libraries +
Install recommended Groovy engine, if you don't have the engine previously installed.
* Use local file +
Browse a local file for the required engine library and install it.
* Add Maven dependency +
Browse the engine dependency and install it. +

Additionally, you can manually add the engine dependency in the `pom.xml` file.

[start=3]
. In the *General* section of the *Execute* tab, press the refresh button to update the values list for the operation.
. In *Engine* select the installed engine.



=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project  file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

* When you use Jython engine not standalone versions in Scripting Module v2.0, the application does not work. Previous Scripting Module versions worked with not standalone versions of Jython. Use Jython standalone version for Scripting Module v2.0. For additional information, see xref:scripting-module/scripting-module-xml-maven.adoc[Scripting Module XML and Maven Support].

* Engine names display differently than in previous Scripting Module versions. When you see different engine names in the Execute configuration tab and Configuration XML tab, occurs because the engine company defines and provides an identifier for both the engine and language name, for example:

[%header,cols="50a,50a"]
|===
|Engine Name| Execute UI Configuration | Configuration XML
|Groovy |Groovy Scripting Engine | Groovy
|Nashorn(JavaScript) |Oracle Nashorn | ECMASCript
|===

* When you see ECMAscript engine as an option to select in the Execute configuration tab without the necessity to install or configure it, indicates that some versions of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) previously installed and use the engine.


=== Reverting the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Scripting Module, in Anypoint Studio do the following:

. In the projectâ€™s `pom.xml` file, change the `mule-scripting-module` dependency version `2.0.0` to the previous version, and delete the engine dependency used.
. Return to the *Execute* tab and in the *Engine* section, select one of the default engines.
. In the *Configuration XML* tab, confirm the selected engine name matches.
