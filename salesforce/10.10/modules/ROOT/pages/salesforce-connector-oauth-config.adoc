= Configure OAuth 2.0 Connection Types

When configuring an OAuth 2.0 connection, you can specify an object store that stores each resource owner's ID data. If you don't specify an object store, Mule automatically provisions the default object store.

The app interacts with the object store automatically when a new resource owner is authenticated, the access token is refreshed, or the access token is invalidated.

=== Mutual TLS

In v9.7.0 and later, all authentication types support mutual TLS. To use mutual TLS, you need a keystore file and a password for the file. See <<Generate a Keystore File>> for more information.

Specify the path to the keystore file and the password in the configuration window:

Any user requiring mutual TLS authentication can log in using the connector.

To set up a mutual TLS certificate in your Salesforce environment, see https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_keys_uploading_mutual_auth_cert.htm&type=5[Set Up a Mutual Authentication Certificate].
