Allow the deployment to fail.

* `false`

Ignore the results of the connectivity test. |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<Reconnect>>
* <<ReconnectForever>> | Reconnection strategy to use. |  | 
|===

=== Reconnect

Configures a standard reconnection strategy, which specifies how often to reconnect and how many reconnection attempts the connector source or operation can make.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  | 
| Blocking a| Boolean | If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |  | 
| Count a| Number | How many reconnection attempts the Mule app can make. |  | 
|===

=== Reconnect Forever

Configures a forever reconnection strategy by which the connector source or operation attempts to reconnect at a specified frequency for as long as the Mule app runs.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Frequency a| Number | How often to attempt to reconnect, in milliseconds. |  | 
| Blocking a| Boolean | If `false`, the reconnection strategy runs in a separate, non-blocking thread. |  | 
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

Configures an expiration policy strategy.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | Configures the maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  | 
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | Time unit for the *Max Idle Time* field. |  |

=== Redelivery Policy

Configures the redelivery policy for executing requests that generate errors. You can add a redelivery policy to any source in a flow.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | Maximum number of times that a redelivered request can be processed unsuccessfully before returning a REDELIVERY_EXHAUSTED error. |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | Secure hashing algorithm to use if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `true`. If the payload of the message is a Java object, Mule ignores this value and returns the value that the payload's `hashCode()` returned. |  | 
| Message Identifier a| <<RedeliveryPolicyMessageIdentifier>> | One or more expressions that determine if a message was redelivered. This property can be set only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  | 
| Object Store a| ObjectStore | Configures the object store that stores the redelivery counter for each message. |  | 
|===

=== Redelivery Policy Message Identifier

Configures how to identify a redelivered message and how to find out when the message was redelivered.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | If `true`, Mule uses a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | One or more expressions that determine when a message was redelivered. You can set this property only if the *Use Secure Hash* field is `false`. |  | 
|===

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of instances that is initially be allowed to be kept in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
|===

[[RepeatableFileStoreIterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
