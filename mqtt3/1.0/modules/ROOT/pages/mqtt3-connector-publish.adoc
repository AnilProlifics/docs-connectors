= Publish Messages to an MQTT Broker with MQTT Connector

In the following example, you configure the Anypoint Connector for MQTT (MQTT Connector) *Publish* operation, which enables you to publish a message to the desired topic and with a specific quality of service (QoS).

. In Studio > *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. Set *Path* to `/mqtt3/publish`.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. Configure the HTTP Listener global element and click *OK*.
. In Studio > *Mule Palette*, select *MQTT3 > On New Message*.
. Drag *On New Message* to the Studio canvas.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. In *MQTT3 Config* > *Connection*, select *MQTT3 URL Connection*.
. For *Client id generator*, select *Client id random suffix generator*.
. Set the following fields:
+
* *Client ID*: `smart-bentley-123`
* *Username*: `usertest`
* *Password*: `passtest`
* *URL*: `tcp://127.0.0.1:1883`
[start=13]
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Publish* configuration screen, set the following fields:
+
* *Topic*: `quotes/terryPratchett`
* *Message* `#["Stories of imagination tend to upset those without one."]`
* *QoS*: *AT_LEAST_ONCE (Default)*
* *Is retained*: *True*

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `<mqtt3:publish>` and `topic` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mqtt3:config name="MQTT_Config">
    <mqtt3:connection username="usertest" password="passtest" url="tcp://127.0.0.1:1883">
        <mqtt3:client-id-generator>
            <mqtt3:client-id-random-suffix-generator clientId="smart-bentley-123" />
        </mqtt3:client-id-generator>
    </mqtt3:connection>
</mqtt3:config>

<flow name="publishQuote">
    <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener" path="/mqtt3/publish" />
    <mqtt3:publish config-ref="MQTT_Config" topic="quotes/terryPratchett" qos="AT_LEAST_ONCE" isRetained="true">
        <mqtt3:message>#["Stories of imagination sample quote."]</mqtt3:message>
    </mqtt3:publish>
</flow>

== Mark Messages as Retained

By default, a broker discards a received message on a topic for which there are no current subscribers. If you want the broker to retain the message, configure *Is retained* to `True`. The broker stores the last retained message and the corresponding quality of service for the selected topic. +
Each client that subscribes to a topic pattern that matches the topic of the retained message receives the retained message after they subscribe. The broker stores only one retained message per topic. This enables new subscribers to receive the most current existing value rather than waiting for the next update from a publisher.
