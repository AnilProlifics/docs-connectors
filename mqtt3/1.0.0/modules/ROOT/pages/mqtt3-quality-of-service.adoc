= MQTT3 Quality of Service
:page-aliases: connectors::mqtt3/mqtt3-quality-of-service.adoc

The MQTT protocol allows you to specify levels of delivery assurance for inbound or outbound messages. These levels
are referred to as quality of service (QoS).

The available quality of service levels are:

 * AT_MOST_ONCE: the message will be delivered at most one time (fire and forget). Does not guarantee the message will be received at all.
 * AT_LEAST_ONCE: the message will be delivered correctly at least one time. The message could be delivered more than once.
 * EXACTLY_ONCE: guarantees that the message will be delivered correctly exactly one time.

The quality of service can be different for publishing and subscribing, even if the published message and the subscription
have a common topic. So, a message can be published with QoS 1 or 2, and still not reach the listener, if said listener
has subscribed with QoS AT_MOST_ONCE (QoS=0).
