[[Config]]
=== Config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| * <<Config_Connection, MQTT3 Connection>> {nbsp}
* <<Config_Resilient, MQTT3 Resilient Connection>> {nbsp}
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit. |  | {nbsp}
