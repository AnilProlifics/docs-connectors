MQTT3 Connector v1.0

Anypoint Connector for MQTT3 (MQTT3 Connector) is an MQTT v3 compliant MuleSoft extension. The connector consumes and produces MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) messages. MQTT3 Connector supports all MQTT version 3 functionalities including message retention, last will and testament messages, and persistent sessions.
