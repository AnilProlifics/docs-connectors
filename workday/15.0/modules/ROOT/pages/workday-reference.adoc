[[repeatable-in-memory-stream]]
=== Repeatable In-Memory Stream

When streaming in this mode, Mule does not use the disk to buffer the contents. If you exceed the buffer size, the message fails.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that is allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the Buffer Size Increment field, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used, then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |
|===

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

File store repeatable streams require buffering, and there are different buffering strategies. Mule keeps a portion of contents in memory. If the stream contents are larger than the configured buffer size, Mule backs up the buffer’s content to disk and then clears the memory.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
|===

[non-repeatable-stream]
