== Use a Query as a Filter

. In the Anypoint Studio's *Filter* field, select the *Query* value, which enables you to create your own filter.
. In the *Value* field, enter the filter options using the format described in the https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/[ODATA URI Conventions] site, item 4.5. +
You don't need to add the *Entity set name* in the query; you have to select it from the list.

Examples:

* `startswith(username, 'Mule') eq true`
* `startswith(username, 'JA') eq true or endswith(username, 'n3') eq true`
* `username eq 'Mike'`

The Query value is only used for the *Filter* field; the connector builds the actual query.

== Next Step

After you complete configuring the connector, you can try 
the xref:sap-successfactors-connector-examples.adoc[Examples].
