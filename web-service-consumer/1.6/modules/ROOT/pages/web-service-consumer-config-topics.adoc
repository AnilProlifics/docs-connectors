= Web Service Consumer Additional Configuration Information - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::web-service/web-service-consumer-configure.adoc

Set additional configuration for Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector), such as custom HTTP Transport and Web Service Security both in Anypoint Studio and XML editor.

== Configure Custom HTTP Transport

By default, the connector uses a simple nonprotected HTTP configuration to dispatch all outgoing SOAP messages. For cases where a more advanced HTTP configuration is required, you can parameterize the Web Service Consumer Connector with an HTTP Connector configuration to dispatch the messages.

In the following example, you declare and reference an HTTP Requester configuration with HTTP Basic authentication in the *Transport Configuration* parameter of the Web Service Consumer Connector configuration, so the connector dispatches each requests using the advanced configuration:

. In Studio, open the *Global Element Properties* window of the Web Service Consumer Connector.
. On the *Transport* tab, for *Transport Configuration* select `HTTP Transport Configuration`. +
The *Requester Config* field automatically populates `HTTP_Request_configuration`.
. Click *OK*

In Studio, configuring Custom HTTP Transport looks as follows:

.Configure Custom HTTP Transport

In the *Configuration XML* tab, the HTTP Requester and HTTP Basic authentication `<http:request-config name="basic-auth">` is referenced in the Web Service Consumer configuration under `<wsc:custom-transport-configuration>`, and looks as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:request-config name="basic-auth">
    <http:request-connection host="www.exampleplace.com" port="8182" protocol="HTTP">
        <http:authentication>
            <http:basic-authentication username="admin" password="textpassword"/>
        </http:authentication>
    </http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>

<wsc:config name="with-custom-transport">
    <wsc:connection wsdlLocation="http://www.host.com?WSDL" service="Service" port="Port">
        <wsc:custom-transport-configuration>
            <wsc:http-transport-configuration requesterConfig="basic-auth"/>
        </wsc:custom-transport-configuration>
    </wsc:connection>
</wsc:config>

== Configure Web Service Security

The WS-Security protocol specifies how you can enforce integrity and confidentiality on messages and enables the communication of various security token formats. Its main focus is the use of XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide end-to-end security.

WS-Security describes three main mechanisms:

* How to sign SOAP messages to assure integrity, signed messages also provide nonrepudiation
* How to encrypt SOAP messages to assure confidentiality
* How to attach security tokens to ascertain the sender's identity

The Web Service Consumer Connector supports the following mechanisms:

* Timestamp
* Signature or Signature Verification
* Username
* Encryption or Decryption

In the following example, you configure a username token security strategy as Web Service Security for the connector:

. In Studio, open the *Global Element Properties* window of the Web Service Consumer Connector.
. On the *Security* tab, for *Username token security strategy* select `Edit inline`.
. Set *Username*, *Password* fields, and set *Add nonce* and *Add created* to `true`
. Click *OK*

In Studio, configuring Web Service Security looks as follows:

.Configure Web Service Security

In the *Configuration XML* tab, configuring Web Service Security looks as follows:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wsc:config name="with-custom-transport">
    <wsc:connection wsdlLocation="http://www.host.com?WSDL" service="Service" port="Port">
        <wsc:web-service-security>
            <wsc:username-token-security-strategy username="admin" password="textPassword" addCreated="true" addNonce="true"/>
        </wsc:web-service-security>
    </wsc:connection>
</wsc:config>
