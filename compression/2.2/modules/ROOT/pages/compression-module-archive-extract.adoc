= Archiving and Extracting Multiple Entries

The Compression module provides the *Archive* operation that enables you to compress a set of entries into a new archive file and the *Extract* operation that enables you to decompress content that represents an archive file. 


== Configure Archive Operation

Given an input stream payload, the *Archive* operation enables you to compress all the payload entries into a new archive file in the `Zip` format. The operation receives a map that identifies the entries' values to compress. Then, the operation receives each entry, which is placed inside the compressed archive file with the entry name you provide in a DataWeave expression.

. In Studio, drag the *Archive* operation to your flow.
. Set *Entries* to a DataWeave script defining each name of the entry to compress as a key and the content of that entry as its value, for example:
+
[source,dataweave, linenums]
----
{
         summary.pdf: vars.summary,
         'details/result_001.pdf': vars.file1
         'details/result_002.pdf': vars.file2
       }
----

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the configuration looks like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:archive>
   <compression:entries>
    #[
       {
         summary.pdf: vars.summary,
         'details/result_001.pdf': vars.file1
         'details/result_002.pdf': vars.file2
       }
     ]
   </compression:entries>
   <compression:archiver>
       <compression:zip-archiver/>
   </compression:archiver>
</compression:archive>
----

The resulting archive contains three entries, one named `summary.pdf` at the root level, the others called `result_001.pdf` and `result_002.pdf`, inside a directory called `details`:

[source]
----
+- content.zip
|  \- summary.pdf
|  \+ details
   |  \- result_001.pdf
   |  \- result_002.pdf

----

Note that the slash `/` in the name of an entry, for example, `details/result_001.pdf` indicates a directory separation. All names are introspected to create directories inside the archive.

[NOTE]
If you create the input to the *Archive* operation using a DataWeave expression, the DataWeave expression must output an object, used to build the Java map object. Define unique keys to add the entire object to the archive.

== Configure ZIP64 Archiver Strategy

An archiver strategy compresses multiple entries into an archive. The Zip archiver strategy declares that the content must be compressed using the `Zip` format. In Studio, the *Archiver* field is set by default. To archive files and byte arrays greater than 4 GB, select the *Force ZIP64* field.

. In Studio, select the *Archive* operation from your flow.
. Set the *Entries* field to the following expression, for example:
+
[source,DataWeave]
----
output application/java
---
(0 to sizeOf(payload) - 1) as Array
reduce (index, acc={}) ->
acc ++ { (payload[index].attributes.fileName): payload[index].payload}
----

[start=3]
. Select *Force ZIP64*.

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the `zip-archiver` and `forceZip64` configuration look like this:

[source, xml]
----
<compression:archive doc:name="Archive">
<compression:entries>
<![CDATA[#[output application/java
---
(0 to sizeOf(payload) - 1) as Array
reduce (index, acc={}) ->
acc ++ { (payload[index].attributes.fileName): payload[index].payload}]]]>
</compression:entries>
<compression:archiver>
<compression:zip-archiver forceZip64="true"/>
</compression:archiver>
</compression:archive>
----

== Configure Extract Operation

The *Extract* operation enables you to decompress content that represents an archive in some compression format. The entries of the archive file are returned as objects, each accessible by its entry name.

. In Studio, select the *Extract* operation from your flow.
. Set the *Compressed* field to `vars.archive`.

image::compression-zip64-archiver.png[Force ZIP64 field selected]

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the configuration looks like this:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<compression:extract>
    <compression:compressed>#[vars.archive]</compression:compressed>
    <compression:extractor>
        <compression:zip-extractor/>
    </compression:extractor>
</compression:extract>
----

Now, assume that you decompress an archive with three entries that contain the following structure:

[source]
----
+- Archive
|  \- summary.pdf
|  \+ details
   |  \- result_001.pdf
   |  \- result_002.pdf
----

In this case, you can access the extracted contents of the entries using:
`payload['summary.pdf']` or `payload.details['result_001.pdf']`

== Configure Zip Extractor Strategy

An extractor strategy decompresses an archive with multiple entries that are compressed in a particular format.
The Zip archive strategy declares that the content must be extracted with the `Zip` format. In Studio, the *Extractor* field is set by default.

In the *Configuration XML* editor, the configuration looks like this:

[source, xml]
----
<compression:zip-archiver/>
