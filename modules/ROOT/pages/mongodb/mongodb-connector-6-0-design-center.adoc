Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see the xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-reference.adoc[MongoDB Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click the name of the trigger card.
. To use the MongoDB connector as an input source trigger, choose xref:mongodb/mongodb-connector-reference.adoc#object-listener[Object Listener].
+
Alternatively, you can trigger your app using HTTP Listener or Scheduler.
+
Design Center automatically saves changes you make in a session.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Enter the required values in the *General* tab.
