== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Changed operation names, metadata, fields, and values
+
*Reviewers, what values were changed? I do not see them in the PR. Also, were some operations added besides the Object Listener input source?*
+
* Changed input sources
* Changed connection types

=== Changes in the Connection Types and Connection Configuration

This release contains the following changes to connection configuration and types:

* Removed the Connection String connection type. There is now a single, unified generic connection that contains the configurable properties that were previously available in the Connection String connection type.
* Removed the Metadata configuration section. MongoDB 6.0 automatically generates the metadata.
* Added Read concern options in the Advanced tab, with the following fields:
** Read Concern: Enables the control of the consistency and isolation properties of the data read from replica sets and replica set shards.
** Read Preference: Specifies the read preferences for this connection.
** Maximum Staleness Seconds: Specifies how stale a secondary can be before the client stops using it for read operations. A value of -1 means that there is no maximum stateleness set.
** Read Preference Tags: Enables you to specify a tag set in the read preference to target those members associated with a tag in the set.
* Added Write concern options in the Advanced tab, with the following fields:
** Write Concern Acknowledgment: Requests acknowledgment that the write operation was propagated to the specified number of instances.
** Write Concern Timeout: Specifies a time limit for the write concern.
** Write Concern Timeout Timeunit: Specifies a time unit for the Write Concern Timeout field.

Changes in the generic connection type:

* In the General tab:
** Required Libraries: Reference to the MongoDB Driver, its version must be 3.11 or higher.
** Server Addresses is now is a list of server addresses to use for the connection.
* Added a new Security tab for TLS context configuration.
* In the Advanced tab, added the following new fields:
** Authentication Mechanism: The authentication Mechanism used for this connection
** Replica Set Name: Name of the replica set to which to connect.
** Authentication Source: Database name associated with the userâ€™s credentials.
** Compressors: List of compressors for which to enable network compression for communication between this client and a mongod/mongos instance.
** Zlib Compression Level: Integer that specifies the compression level if using zlib for network compression. Set this field to 0 for no compression. Set this field to 1-9 for compression, with 1 being the lowest compression level, and 9 the highest. High compression levels, such as 9, require the more processing time.
** Connection Timeout: Connection timeout used when establishing the socket connections
** Connection Timeout Time Unit: Unit for the Connection Timeout field
** Local Threshold: Size of the latency window for selecting among multiple, suitable MongoDB instances
** Local Threshold Time Unit: Unit for the Local Threshold Time Unit field.
** Server Selection Timeout: How long to block for server selection before throwing an exception
** Server Selection Timeout Time Unit: Time unit for the Server Selection Timeout Fields
** Socket Timeout: Maximum time to wait for a send or receive operation on a socket before the attempt times out
** Socket Timeout Time Unit: Unit for the  Socket Timeout field
** Min Connections Pool Size: Minimum size for the connection pool
** Max Pool Connections Size: Maximum size for the connection pool
** Max Wait Queue Time: Maximum wait queue time for the connection pool
** Max Wait Queue Time Unit: Unit for the Maximum Wait Queue Time field
** Max Connection Lifetime Time: Maximum connection lifetime for the connection pool
** Max Connection Lifetime Time Unit: Unit for the Maximum Connection lifetime field
** Maximum Connection Idle Time: Unit for the Maximum Connection Idle pool
** Maximum Connection Idle Unit: Unit for the Maximum Connection Idle Time field.

== Changed Operations Metadata

MongoDB 5.x generated operations metadata when the user provided a set of documents per collection from which to take the attributes. MongoDB 6.0 generates metadata automatically, based on the latest document in each collection.

=== Metadata in MongoDB v6.0

[%header,cols="34%,33%,33%"]
|===
|Operation Name	| Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| Insert Document
|Document
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structure as input-output metadata.

| Insert Documents
|Document
|Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structures structure as input/output metadata.

| Update Documents
| N/A
| JSON that contains the following structure: { "matched" : int, "modified" : int, upsertedId: JSON }

| Remove Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Count Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Find Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector uses the structure of the first document in the given collection.
*Reviwers, in the last sentence, what does the connector use the structure of the first document for?*

| Create File
| N/A
a|** A GridFS JSON object with the following structure:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata

| Find Files
| N/A
a|** List<InputStream> +
Each InputStream is a GridFS JSON object with the following attributes:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata

|List files | Lists all files that match the given query and sorts them by filename | N/A | N/A
|Find one file | Returns the first file that matches the given query | Find files | Giving a specific file to the query
|===

== Changes in Input Sources
MongoDB 6.0.0 has one input source only, Object Listener, which retrieves all of the created documents that belong to a specific collection.

The Delete Sources and Update Sources input sources were removed.
+
*Reviewers, I don't see these sources. The only sources I see in the Reference Guide are Deleted Object, Modified Object, and New Object. Do you mean that these sources were removed?*

=== Metadata in Object Listener

[%header,cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| N/A
| The connector resolves output metadata dynamically based on the selected value of the Collection Name parameter. The connector reads the last document of the given collection and uses the document's structure as output metadata.

== Changes in Connection types
The Connection String type was removed in this version, which leaves only one Generic Connection.

== Requirements and Limitations

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
.Install MongoDB v6.0 to replace the MongoDB operations that were previously included in MongoDB Connector v5.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from MongoDB Connector v5.3.x to MongoDB Connector v6.0:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click Search in Exchange.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `Salesforce 10` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Salesforce Connector 6.0* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the salesforce-connector dependency version is 6.0.0 in the `pom.xml` file.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of MongoDB Connector, change the mule-mongodb-connector dependency version 6.0.0 in the projectâ€™s `pom.xml` to the previous version.
