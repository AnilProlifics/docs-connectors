== Changed Operations, Parameters, and Return Types

*Reviewers, I created a table like this for the Salesforce Connector: https://docs.mulesoft.com/connectors/salesforce/salesforce-connector-100-upgrade-migrate#changed-operations-parameters-and-return-types. In this table, we are specific about what the changes were.*

The following table shows changes to operation names, input parameters, and return types:

== Changed Operations Metadata

MongoDB 5.x generated operations metadata when the user provided a set of documents per collection from which to take the attributes. MongoDB 6.0 generates metadata automatically, based on the latest document in each collection.

=== Metadata in MongoDB v6.0

[%header,cols="34%,33%,33%"]
|===
|Operation Name	| Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| Insert Document
|Document
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structures structure as input/output metadata.

| Insert Documents
|Document
|Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector adds the latest document of the given collection and uses the document's structures structure as input/output metadata.

| Update Documents
| N/A
| JSON that contains the following structure: { "matched" : int, "modified" : int, upsertedId: JSON }

| Remove Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Count Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| N/A

| Find Documents
| Query: JSON Object
| Resolved dynamically based on the selected value of the collection parameter. The connector uses the structure of the first document in the given collection.
*Reviwers, in the last sentence, what does the connector use the structure of the first document for?*

| Create File
| N/A
a|** A GridFS JSON object with the following structure:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata

| Find Files
| N/A
a|** List<InputStream> +
Each InputStream is a GridFS JSON object with the following attributes:
* JSON Id
* String fileName
* Long Length
* Int ChunkSize
* Datetime uploadDate
* JSON Metadata
|===

== Removed Operations

The following operations were removed from the MongoDB connector:

[%header,cols="15%,35%,15%,35%"]
|===
2+|Removed from MongoDB 5.x 2+| Can be reproduced in MongoDB 6.0.0 through
|Name	| Description	|Name	|Description
|Incremental dump | Executes an incremental dump of the database. | Dump | Use the Dump operation.
|Restore | Takes the output from the dump and restores it | Restore from file or Restore from directory | These operations take the output from the dump file or directory and restore it.
|Update documents by function | Update documents using a Mongo function | N/A | N/A
|Update documents by functions | Update documents using one or more Mongo functions | N/A | N/A
|Find one and update document | Finds and updates the first document that matches a given query | N/A | This operation's functionality can be reproduced by combining other operations
*Reviewers, can you provide examples*
|Save document | Inserts or updates a document based on its object ID | N/A | N/A
|Find one document | Finds the first document that matches a given query | Find documents | Set the Limit=1 to return one document.
|Execute generic command | Executes a generic command on the database | Execute command | Executes a command on the database
|List files | Lists all files that match the given query and sorts them by filename | N/A | N/A
|Find one file | Returns the first file that matches the given query | Find files | Giving a specific file to the query
|===

== Changes in Input Sources
MongoDB 6.0.0 has one input source only, Object Listener, which retrieves all of the created documents that belong to a specific collection.

The Delete Sources and Update Sources input sources were removed.
+
*Reviewers, I don't see these sources. The only sources I see in the Reference Guide are Deleted Object, Modified Object, and New Object. Do you mean that these sources were removed?*

=== Metadata in Object Listener

[%header,cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Input Metadata	|Output Metadata

| N/A
| The connector resolves output metadata dynamically based on the selected value of the Collection Name parameter. The connector reads the last document of the given collection and uses the document's structure as output metadata.
|===

== Changes in Connection types
The Connection String type was removed in this version, which leaves only one Generic Connection.

== Requirements and Limitations

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must:

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
.Install MongoDB v6.0 to replace the MongoDB operations that were previously included in MongoDB Connector v5.x.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade from MongoDB Connector v5.3.x to MongoDB Connector v6.0:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click Search in Exchange.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, enter `Salesforce 10` in the search field.
. In the *Available modules* section, select *Salesforce Connector 6.0* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the salesforce-connector dependency version is 6.0.0 in the `pom.xml` file.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project `pom.xml` file and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of MongoDB Connector, change the mule-mongodb-connector dependency version 6.0.0 in the project’s `pom.xml` to the previous version.
