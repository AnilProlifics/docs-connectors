The Cassandra DB connector configuration must match the Cassandra configuration with regard to Basic Authentication.
By default, accessing the Cassandra database does not require credentials, so you need to configure Cassandra to enable authentication.
After enabling authentication, run the `cqlsh` command from the Cassandra installation home directory as shown in this example. It uses default credentials with the username cassandra and password cassandra:

[source,text,linenums]
----
bin/cqlsh localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra
Connected to Test Cluster at localhost:9042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.10 | CQL spec 3.4.4 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
----

. After installing the Cassandra Connector, open the `conf\cassandra.yaml` file for editing.
. Optionally, change the value of `AllowAllAuthenticator` to `PasswordAuthenticator`.
. Restart the Cassandra Connector.
. In a separate terminal tab, check that Cassandra is running by entering:
+
`bin/nodetool status`
