DDL statements are a special type of SQL statement that do not access or modify data.
Instead, they create, modify, or destroy data structures, stored procedures, and so on.


== Create Table Example

Suppose there is a database schema called *Products* and also there is a
xref:db/db-configure-connection.adoc[connection], named `dbConfig`, configured to access it.
The following `Execute DDL` operation will create a new table called *electronic* with
columns *id, name, description, price* and *discount*:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:execute-ddl config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>
        CREATE TABLE electronic(
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(100),
            description VARCHAR(255),
            price SMALLINT,
            discount TINYINT
        )
    </db:sql>
</db:execute-ddl>
----

This operation returns the number `0` if the table was successfully created, otherwise
it throws an error.
