DDL statements are a special type of SQL statement that do not access or modify data.
Instead, they create, modify, or destroy data structures, stored procedures, and so on.


== Create Table Example

Suppose there is a database schema named *Products*. There is also a
xref:db/db-configure-connection.adoc[connection] named `dbConfig` that is configured to access *Products*.
The following operation, called `Execute DDL`, creates a new table called *electronic* which has
columns named *id*, *name*, *description*, *price*, and *discount*:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:execute-ddl config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>
        CREATE TABLE electronic(
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(100),
            description VARCHAR(255),
            price SMALLINT,
            discount TINYINT
        )
    </db:sql>
</db:execute-ddl>
----

The `Execute DDL` operation creates a table and returns `0` unless there is an error.
