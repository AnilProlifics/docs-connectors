DDL statements are a special type of SQL statement that do not access or modify data. Instead, they create, modify, or destroy data structures, stored procedures, and so on.


== Create Table Example

Suppose we have a database schema called *Products* and we have already
xref:db/db-configure-connection.adoc[configured a connection] for it, which we named `dbConfig`.
If we want to create a new table called *electronic* with columns *id, name,
description, price* and *discount* we would use the `Execute DDL` operation like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<db:execute-ddl config-ref="dbConfig">
    <db:sql>
        CREATE TABLE electronic(
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(100),
            description VARCHAR(255),
            price SMALLINT,
            discount TINYINT
        )
    </db:sql>
</db:execute-ddl>
----

This operation returns the number `0` if the table was successfully created, otherwise it throws an error.
