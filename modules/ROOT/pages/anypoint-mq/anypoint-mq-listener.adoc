The Subscriber source in the Anypoint MQ connector provides ability to consume Messages as they arrive to the Destination. Tunning of the subscriber behavior will be done from the Connector's configuration. 

== Using Message Prefetch

Out of the box, the connector will provide a configuration aimed for maximum message throughput. This means that message `prefetch` is enabled, with the maximum `fetchSize` possible.

When using `prefetch` mode, the subscriber will attempt to keep a *local buffer of three times the `fetchSize`* filled at any given time, meaning that it will *make as many service calls as needed (with up to three concurrent calls) to retrieve messages* and make them available to the buffer. Then, Messages will be taken from this local buffer and dispatched to the flow for its processing.

Keep in mind that in a common scenario, the buffer will most likely never be full, given that Mule will accept many messages very fast using as many threads as possible to process them concurrently.
Is also important to notice that not all the requests to the service may provide the maximum number of messages possible defined by the *fetchSize*, so more than three requests may be necessary to fill the buffer in cases of low load.

Prefetch can be tunned using the configuration element in the following way:

[source,xml,linenums]
----

<anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config name="defaultPrefetchConfig" 
                                       fetchSize="5" fetchTimeout="1000" frequency="4000">
    <anypoint-mq:connection url="${providerUrl}" clientId="${clientId}" clientSecret="${clientSecret}"/>
</anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config>

<flow name="prefetchedListener">
    <anypoint-mq:subscriber config-ref="defaultPrefetchConfig" destination="${invoiceQueue}"/> 
    
    <!-- Message processing-->
</flow>
----


In this example, we are *reducing the ammount of messages retrieved per API call, thus reducing the buffer size*, effectively having a buffer of 15 messages instead of the 30 that are preserved by default.

Other parameters like `fetchTimeout` and `frequency` will modify the behaviour of the subscriber when the Queue is empty and it's waiting for a message to arrive.

For details on how each parameter works, please refer to xref:anypoint-mq/anypoint-mq-connector-reference.adoc#configurations[Configuration Reference].

=== Buffer, Acknowledgment and AcknowledgmentTimeout

While in the buffer, the messages will be kept as in-flight for the broker, so no redelivery occurs, as long as needed for the Message to be dispatched to the flow, or the subscriber is stopped and the buffer cleared.
Once dispatched, the message will remain as in-flight until the `acknowledgmentTimeout` is evicted.

By default, the Message consumed will be ACKed only when the execution of the flow receiving the message completes successfully.If instead, an error occurs during the execution of the flow, the Session will be recovered and the Message will be redelivered.

== Polling for New Messages

In order have more control on how many messages are consumed by each subscriber, we can use a *polling* configuration, thus polling for messages from the service at a fixed rate.


This behaviour is achived effectively by disabling `prefetch` by setting a `fetchSize` of zero. When using the *polling mode, the connector will allways attempt to fetch 10 messages* per request, where each request is done at the fixed rate defined by the `pollingTime`. No overlapping requests will be executed and only one request per poll will be done to the service.

The syntax to listen for new messages from a Queue at a fixed rate is:

[source,xml,linenums]
----

<anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config name="pollingConfig" fetchSize="0" pollingTime="1000"    
                                        acknowledgementTimeout="5000">
    <anypoint-mq:connection url="${providerUrl}" clientId="${clientId}" clientSecret="${clientSecret}"/>
</anypoint-mq:default-subscriber-config>

<flow name="prefetchedListener">
    <anypoint-mq:subscriber config-ref="pollingConfig" destination="${invoiceQueue}"/> 
    
    <!-- Message processing-->
</flow>
----

The source above will try to retrieve 10 messages from the Queue identified by the destination every 1 second, 
and then dispatch each of them to the flow as a `MuleMessage`. In this case, the message will remain as *in-flight* for 5 seconds.

The _MuleMessage_ will have:

* The message's content as payload.
* The message's metadata in the message attributes.

By default, the Message consumed will be ACKed only when the execution of the flow receiving the message completes successfully.
If instead, an error occurs during the execution of the flow, the Session will be recovered and the Message will be redelivered.
