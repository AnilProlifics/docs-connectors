== Create Object Operation

In the `Create Object` operation, set the `Content Length` to a value greater than zero. If the `Content Length` is set to zero (0), the `Create Object` operation creates a zero-byte object.

== Use an AWS KMS Master Key

To encrypt objects that you want to store in S3 buckets using customer managed master keys, specify a Customer Master Key ID in the `KMS Master Key` field in the `Create Object` configuration.

== Next Step

After you understand how to configure a master key and provide credentials, you can try out the xref:amazon/amazon-s3-connector-examples.adoc[Example].
