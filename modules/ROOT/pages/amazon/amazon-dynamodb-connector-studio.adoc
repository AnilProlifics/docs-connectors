= Use Studio to Configure Amazon DynamoDB - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Studio editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Create a Mule project.
. Supply your authentication credentials to Anypoint Platform.
. Add the connector to your Mule project.
. Configure an input source for the connector's flow.
. Configure the connector.

== Best Practices

Follow these best practices when you configure an input source and connector in Studio:

* Configure an associated global element for the input source and connector.
* Create a YAML or properties file to contain your properties, and then reference the file from the configuration.
* Configure a reconnection strategy for the input source and target connector.

== Add the Connector to Your Project

Add Amazon DynamoDB Connector to a Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "Amazon DynamoDB" in the search field.
. Click the *AmazonDynamoDB* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. Configure an input source for Amazon DynamoDB Connector's flow, such as an HTTP Listener operation (HTTP Listener) or Scheduler endpoint.

== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

To configure a connector in your Mule app, first configure a global element that can be used by all instances of that connector in the flow:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for the connector and select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the canvas to the right of the input source.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the Connector configuration field to add a global element for the connector.
. Specify the global element properties for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab in the global element properties, specify a reconnection strategy, if supported.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

. Configure the parameters as follows:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration for the connector to reference.
|Session Token | Enter the session token provided by Amazon STS.
|Access Key | Enter the alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key | Enter the key that serves the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Select the checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|===
+
Placeholder values refer to the `mule-artifact.properties` configuration file in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project.
+
You can either enter your credentials in the global configuration properties,
or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
+
. Keep the *Advanced* tab Reconnection strategy with the default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon DynamoDB.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.
+
Your configuration should look like this:
