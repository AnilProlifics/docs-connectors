* From the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar
* From the Mule Palette view

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "dynamo".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type "dynamo" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration for the connector to reference.
|Session Token | Enter the session token provided by Amazon STS.
|Access Key | Enter the alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key | Enter the key that serves the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Select the checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|===
+
Placeholder values refer to the `mule-artifact.properties` configuration file in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project.
+
You can either enter your credentials in the global configuration properties,
or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
+
. Keep the *Advanced* tab Reconnection strategy with the default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon DynamoDB.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.
+
Your configuration should look like this:
