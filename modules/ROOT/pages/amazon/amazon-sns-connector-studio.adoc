To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Install the connector.
. Configure the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.

== Install the Connector

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange *(X)* icon in the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, select *All assets* and search for *Amazon SNS Connector*.
. Select *Amazon SNS Connector*, and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Configure the Connector

To use the Amazon SNS connector in your Mule app, configure a global Amazon SNS element that can be used by all the Amazon SNS connectors in the application.

. Drag and drop a connector operation into the Studio canvas.
. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *Amazon SNS configuration*:

+
. Click *OK*.
. Specify the global element properties:

In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the  `src` folder of your project.
. Configure the parameters as follows.
+
[%header,cols="30a,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|*Access Key* |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|*Secret Key* |Key that plays the role of a password.
|*Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain* |Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|*Region Endpoint*| Set the topic region endpoint.
|*Globally Defined Default Topic Arn* |Topic ARN to test the connectivity.
|===
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the `src` folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, MuleSoft recommends that you use a configuration file.
+
. Leave the default entries for the *Proxy* and *Advanced* tabs.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon SNS.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for the connector such as an *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler*.
