// Add transition
To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:
. Install the connector.
. Configure the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.

== Install the Connector

. In Studio, create a Mule Project.
. Click the Exchange *(X)* icon in the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, select *All assets* and search for `Amazon SQS`.
. Select Amazon SQS, click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Configure the Connector

To use the Amazon SQS connector in your Mule application, configure a global element that can be used by all Amazon SQS connectors in the application.

. Drag and Drop a connector operation onto the Studio canvas.
. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
.. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and then select *Amazon SQS* Configuration:
+

+
. Click *OK*.
. Specify the global element properties:
+

+
[%header%autowidth.spread]

. Configure the parameters as follows:
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Name used to reference the configuration.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try AWS Credentials Provider Chain|Dropdown that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|Region Endpoint |The regional endpoint to process your requests.
|Default Global URL |URL of the Amazon SQS queue to act upon.
|===
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the src folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, MuleSoft recommends that you use a configuration file.
+
When a Queue Name is provided in the global element, the connector automatically creates the queue and sets the URL of this queue as Queue URL. All Amazon SQS Message processors that reference the global element perform operations using this Queue URL.

To reference a different Queue URL for a particular message processor in the flow, you can perform the operation using the Queue URL attribute provided by the message processor.
. Leave the default entries for the *Proxy* and *Advanced* tabs.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon SQS.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configuration.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for the connector such as a connector operation, *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Next Step

After configuring the connector for use in Studio, see the
xref:amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information]
topic for more configuration steps.
