Amazon SQS Connector Version Major.Minor

The Anypoint Connector for Amazon SQS provides an easy way to interface with the Amazon Simple Queue Service API, allowing Mule users to manage SQS queueing services without having to deal with the API directly.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed application components performing different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.

The AWS SDK for Java provides a Java API for AWS infrastructure services. The Amazon SQS connector is built using the SDK for Java.

Amazon SQS connector provides support for two types of queues "Standard Queue" and "FIFO Queue". Standard queues have high throughput but occasionally more than one copy of a message can be delivered and messages can be delivered in an order different from which they are sent. FIFO queues have limited throughput, but messages are delivered in exactly the same order in which they are sent.
