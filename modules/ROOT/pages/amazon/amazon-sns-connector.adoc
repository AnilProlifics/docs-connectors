Amazon SNS Connector v4.3

The Anypoint Connector for Amazon SNS provides connectivity to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) API, enabling you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Mule applications can use the Amazon SNS Connector to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

To use the Amazon SNS Connector, you must have the following:

* Access to Amazon Web Services - SNS.
* To access AWS with the connector, you need the credentials in the form of an Amazon IAM.
* Anypoint Studio version 7.0 (or higher) or the Anypoint Design Center.

=== Compatibility

Amazon SNS connector is compatible with:

[%header,cols="20a,80a",width=70%]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime |4.1.x
|AWS SDK for Java |1.11.604
|Java |1.8.0_x
|Anypoint Studio |7.0 or higher
|===

[[install]]
== Install the Connector

=== From Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule Project.
. Click the Exchange *(X)* icon in the upper left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "SNS".
. Select *Amazon SNS Connector - Mule 4*, and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== From Within Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule Project.
. In the Mule Palette, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type the name of the connector in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add >*.
. Click *Finish*.

[[config]]
== Configure the Connector Global Element

To use the Amazon SNS connector in your Mule application, configure a global Amazon SNS element that can be used by all the Amazon SNS connectors in the application.

=== Configure with Studio Visual Editor

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the *Global Configuration Elements* screen, click *Create*. 
+
image::amazon/amazon-sns-config-global-wizard.png[]
+
. In the *Choose Global Type* wizard, expand *Connector Configuration* and select *Amazon SNS Configuration* and click *OK*. 
+
image::amazon/amazon-sns-global-config.png[]
+
In this image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the
`src` folder of your project.
+
. Configure the parameters according to instructions below.
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a",width=80%]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain |Checkbox that controls whether temporary credentials should be used.
|Region Endpoint| Set the topic region endpoint.
|Topic Arn |Topic ARN to test the connectivity.
|===
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reusability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
+
. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection* tabs with their default entries.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate, and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon SNS.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

=== Configure with XML Editor or Standalone

. Ensure that you have included the Amazon SNS namespaces in your configuration file.

. Create a global Amazon SNS configuration outside and above your flows, use the following global configuration code.
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sns:config 
  name="Amazon_SNS_configuration" 
  doc:name="Amazon SNS configuration">
<sns:basic-connection 
  accessKey="${config.accessKey}" 
  secretKey="${config.secretKey}" 
  testTopicArn="${sns.topic.arn}" />
</sns:config>
----
+
If you or your IAM users forget or lose their secret access key, you can create a new access key.

== Use This Connector

Amazon SNS connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform. The connector currently supports the following list of operations:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Operation |Description
| Add Permission | Adds a statement to a topic's access control policy
| Confirm Subscription | The ConfirmSubscription action verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier Subscribe action.

=== Connector Namespace and Schema

When designing your application in Studio, the act of dragging the connector from the palette onto the Anypoint Studio canvas should automatically populate the XML code with the connector namespace and schema location.

Namespace: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/sns+`
Schema Location: `+http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/sns/current/mule-sns.xsd+`

If you are manually coding the Mule application in Studio's XML editor or other text editor, paste the namespace and schema into your Configuration XML.

== Use Cases and Demos

Common use cases for the connector:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Use Case |Description
|Sending Amazon SNS messages to Amazon SQS queues |Amazon SNS works closely with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). By using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event, and also persisted in an Amazon SQS queue for other applications to process at a later time.
|Sending Amazon SNS messages to HTTP/HTTPS endpoints |You can use Amazon SNS to send notification messages to one or more HTTP or HTTPS endpoints. When you subscribe an endpoint to a topic, you can publish a notification to the topic and Amazon SNS sends an HTTP POST request delivering the contents of the notification to the subscribed endpoint.
|===

[[example-use-case]]
=== Demo Mule Application Using the Connector

Send messages to Amazon SQS Queue.

When you subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic, you can publish a message to the topic and Amazon SNS sends an Amazon SQS message to the subscribed queue.

You can subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic using the AWS Management Console for Amazon SQS, which simplifies the process.
