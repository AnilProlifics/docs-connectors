To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Add the connector to your Studio project.
. Configure an input source for the connector.
. Configure the connector.

== Add the Connector to Your Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "s3".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "s3" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for Amazon S3 Connector, such as a connector operation, HTTP connector, or scheduler.

You can put the following operations for the connector in the *Source* area of the Studio canvas:

* *On Deleted Object*
Initiates access to your app when an Amazon S3 object is deleted.
* *On New Object*
Initiates access to your app when an Amazon S3 object is created.

== Configure Amazon S3

To configure this connector:

. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration*, and click *Amazon S3 Configuration*.
. Click *OK*.
. Select *Amazon S3 Configuration (Configuration)*, and click *Edit*.
. Specify the global element properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|Name |Name used to reference the connector instance.
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the AWS account.
|Secret Key |Key that plays the role of a password.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain |Indicates whether to use temporary credentials.
|Region Endpoint |URL entry point for a web service.
|===
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the `src` folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file.
+
. If you are:
+
* Using the default Amazon S3 storage, leave the default entries for *Proxy*, *Security*, and *Advanced* tabs.
* Connecting to a different storage than the default AWS S3, specify its URL in the the *Advanced* tab's *S3 Compatible Storage URL* field .

. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate and that Mule is able to successfully connect to your instance of Amazon S3.
+
Validating a connection with *Test Connection* requires that you have permission in AWS IAM to the action `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`. If you donâ€™t have this permission, the test fails. However, you can still use the connector and the operations to which you have access.
+
Access to operations on Amazon S3 is further controlled through policies. It is not always possible to validate your credentials before the exact operation for which you have access completes. This can vary based on the bucket name and other parameters. For example, the test connection can fail if your credentials have a restricted policy.

. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

== Example of Configuring S3-Compatible Storage

The https://github.com/minio/[MinIO Project] is one example of Amazon S3 storage. If you configure this storage locally, you need to set the S3 Compatible Storage URL to `+http://127.0.0.1:9000+`.

== Next Step

After configuring the connector in Studio,
see the xref:amazon/amazon-s3-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] topic for more configuration steps.
