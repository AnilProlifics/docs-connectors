Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center,
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the
xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see
the xref:amazon/amazon-sns-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon SNS Connector Reference].
