Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center,
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the
xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.
For information on field values, see
the xref:amazon/amazon-sns-connector-reference.adoc[Amazon SNS Connector Reference].

== Configure the Input Source (Trigger)

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click on the trigger card.
. Search for and select *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler*.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your
trigger.
. Click off the trigger card to save the configuration.

== Configure the Target Component


. Click *+* to the right of the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the connector and the operation.
. If needed, specify values that are required in the *General* tab.
. Select *Click here to set it up* to set required fields.
+
For example, if you chose the *Get Topic Attributes* operation, you must select a value for the *Connection* field and then enter values for the *Access Key* and *Secret Key* fields.
+
. Click *Test* to ensure your Design Center app can access Amazon SNS.
