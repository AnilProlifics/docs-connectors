SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud v1.0

The main class of an extension, is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations and sources are going to be declared.



== Configurations
---
[[Config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| * <<Config_BasicAuthentication, Basic Authentication>> 
* <<Config_Oauth2ClientCredentialsAuthentication, Oauth2 Client Credentials Authentication>> 
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Connection timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for the request |  30 | 
| Connection Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to use in the Timeout configurations |  SECONDS | 
| Encoding a| String |  Default character encoding to use in all the messages. If not specified, the default charset in the mule configuration will be used |  | 
| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types
[[Config_BasicAuthentication]]
===== Basic Authentication


Basic Authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.


====== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. |  | x
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log into SAP S/4HANA. |  | x
| Discovery Service Enabled a| Boolean |  Enables automatic service discovery |  true | 
| Discovery Service Path a| String |  URL which will be used for automatic services discovery |  /sap/bc/srt/wsil_ext | 
| Service directory a| String |  Common HTTP directory for all SAP services |   | 
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services which will be added to the list of discovered services |  | 
| Service discovery resolution timeout a| Number |  Connection timeout for service discovery |  30 | 
| Service Discovery Timeout Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS |  Time unit to use in the Timeout configuration |  SECONDS | 
| Default HTTP headers a| Object |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  | 
| Default query parameters a| Object |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  | 
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  | 
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config. |  | 
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
