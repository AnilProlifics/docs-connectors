SAP S/4HANA Cloud Connector v1.0

== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config


==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config_basic-authentication, Basic Authentication>>
 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Time Zone a| String |  The timezone with which the Date objects returned from S/4HANA are converted. |  UTC | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform expires the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime purges the instances when it sees fit. |  | 
|===

==== Connection Types
[[config_basic-authentication]]
===== Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is the simplest way of enforcing access controls because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages. Instead, it uses standard fields in the HTTP header, removing the need for handshakes. This mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way.


====== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Service base URL a| String |  The base URL of the service on SAP S/4HANA to be accessed from the connector. From this base URL all other endpoints derive. |  | x
| Username a| String |  The account username with which to log into SAP S/4 HANA. |  | x
| Password a| String |  The account password with which to log into SAP S/4 HANA. |  | x
| Service discovery relative path a| String |  URL used for automatic services discovery. |  `sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=0002/ServiceCollection` | 
| Unlisted services a| Array of String |  List of services to add to the list of discovered services. |  | 
| Default headers a| Array of <<defaultHeader>> |  Default HTTP headers the message should include. |  | 
| Default query parameters a| Array of <<defaultQueryParam>> |  Default Query parameters the request should include. |  | 
| Proxy configuration a| <<ProxyConfiguration>> |  Proxy configuration for the connector. |  | 
| TLS configuration a| <<Tls>> |  Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS, the HTTP communication is secured using TLS/SSL. If HTTPS is configured as a protocol, a user needs to configure at least the key store in the `tls:context` child element of this `listener-config`. |  | 
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy. |  |
