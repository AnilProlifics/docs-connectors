Studio editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Create a Mule project.
. Supply your authentication credentials to Anypoint Platform.
. Add the connector to your Mule project.
. Configure the connector.

Follow these best practices when you configure an input source and connector in Studio:

* Configure an associated global element for the connector.
* Create a YAML or properties file to contain your properties, and then reference the file from the configuration.


== Add the Connector to Your Project

Add SAP S/4HANA SOAP Connector to a Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as add the required dependencies to the project's pom.xml file.

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `SAP S/4HANA SOAP` in the search field.
. Click the SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.


== Configure an Input Source

This connector does not provide an input source operation. You can configure an input source for the connector using *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Configure a Global Element

To use SAP S/4HANA OData Cloud Connector in a Mule app, you can configure a global SAP S/4HANA configuration element for use by SAP S/4HANA connector operations in your application.

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. In the *Global Configuration Elements* screen, click *Create*.

+
. In the *Choose Global Type* wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, select *SAP S/4HANA Config*, and click *OK*.
. Configure the following values:
+
*General* tab:
. In the *Connection* drop-down, select the connection type:
  * *Basic authentication* +
  For basic authentication, provide the following required values:
  ** Service Base URL +
  Enter the base URL of the SAP S/4HANA instance you want to manage, for example: `mydomain.s4hana.ondemand.com`
  ** Username +
  Enter the SAP S/4HANA user name used to initialize the session.
  ** Password +
  Enter the password used to authenticate the user.
  * *OAuth 2 Application Connection Provider* +
  For OAuth 2.0 authentication, enter the following required information:
  ** Service base URL +
  Enter the base URL of the service provider of the SAP S/4HANA system to access from the connector. All other endpoints are derived from this base URL.
  ** Client ID +
  Enter the OAuth client ID that is registered with the service provider.
  ** Client secret +
  Enter the OAuth client secret that corresponds to the client ID and is registered with the service provider.
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure your access credentials are correct.
+
*Advanced* tab:
+

|Studio Field |Description
|Discovery Service Enabled |Feature switch for service discovery. If disabled, the service discovery relative path is not applied.
|Service directory |Common HTTP directory for all SAP services. You can leave this parameter blank, and specify the HTTP directory individually for every service in the unlisted services list.
|Service discovery relative path |Relative path from the base URL to the service used for automatic services discovery.
|Unlisted services |List of services to add to the list of discovered services.
|Default headers |Custom headers that can be included in each request sent.
|Default query parameter |Custom query parameters to include in each request sent
|TLS configuration |TLS configuration
|Proxy configuration |Configuration for executing requests through a proxy
|===
+
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configuration.

Notes:

* Put placeholder values in the `mule-artifact.content` configuration file in the `src/main/resources` folder of your project.
* You can either enter your credentials in the global configuration content or 
reference a configuration file that contains the values for your credentials. +
Using a configuration file is recommended for simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you 
need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where access credentials may differ.

=== Configure Authentication

To access the data in the SAP S/4HANA SOAP instance, you need to authenticate your applicationâ€™s requests using a supported authentication method. 

. Drag an SAP S/4HANA SOAP Cloud connector operation to the canvas.
. Click the operation.
. Click the green plus sign on the right of *Connector Configuration*.
. In the *Connection* drop-down, select the connection type:
  * *Basic authentication* +
  For basic authentication, provide the following required values:
  ** Service Base URL +
  Enter the URL of the SAP S/4HANA instance you want to manage.
  ** Username +
  Enter the user name used to initialize the session.
  ** Password +
  Enter the password used to authenticate the user.
  * *OAuth 2 Application Connection Provider* +
  For OAuth 2.0 authentication, enter the following required information:
  ** Service base URL +
  Enter the base URL of the service provider of the SAP S/4HANA system to access from the connector. All other endpoints are derived from this base URL.
  ** Client ID +
  Enter the OAuth client ID that is registered with the service provider.
  ** Client secret +
  Enter the OAuth client secret that corresponds to the client ID and is registered with the service provider.
. Enter the required information for the selected connection type, and click *OK*.
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure that your access credentials work.
