After you complete basic SAP connector configuration, you can perform additional
configuration tasks, such as defining extended properties, and  
become familiar with SAP Java Connector (JCo).

== Advanced Tab Settings

If needed, set encoding, version, flag, format, and timeout parameters. 

To change these field values, click the *Advanced* tab at the top of the *Global Element Properties* screen:

[%header,cols="30s,20a,30a,20a"]
|===
|Field |XML Attribute |Description |Default Value
|Display Name |name |Set a reference name of the endpoint used internally by the Mule configuration. |
|Encoding |`encoding` |Set a canonical name for an encoding. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html[Oracle's supported encodings]. |
|Default IDocument Version |`defaultIdocumentVersion` |Set the version when sending an intermediate document (IDoc). Values for the IDoc version correspond to `IDOC_VERSION_xxxx` constants in `com.sap.conn.idoc.IDocFactory`. |
|Disable Function template cache flag |`disableFunctionTemplateCacheFlag` |Set to disable the function template cache. |`false`
|Evaluate response flag |`evaluateResponseFlag` |Set if an error response should throw an exception or let the user handle it with another result. |`false`
|Log trace flag |`logTraceFlag` |Set if the trace should be logged on the Mule server. |`false`
|Use SAP format |`useSAPFormat` |Set to use the SAP default format when working with business application programming interface (BAPI) functions using a synchronous remote function call (sRFC). |false
|Operation timeout |`operationTimeout` |Set a timeout for operations. This is a positive value in milliseconds. A value of 0 means indefinite waiting. |`0`
|===

== Define Extended Properties

Extended properties enable you to tune SAP outbound configuration parameters.

To define extended properties for the SAP connector global element:

. Navigate to the *Advanced* tab on the *General* pane:
+
image::sap/sap-connector-advanced-tab.png[Lower Advanced Tab]
+
. Locate the *Extended Properties* section at the top of the window.
. Select the *Edit inline* option.
. Click *+* to add a new extended property - use the same property name that SAP uses.

== JCo Configuration Notes

The SAP Java Connector facilitates communication between an SAP backend system and a Java application. SAP JCo allows Java programs to connect to SAP systems and invoke remote function modules. SAP JCo also allows parsing of IDocs (SAP Intermediate Documents), among other object types. Both inbound and outbound communications are supported.

These JCo components facilitate communication with the SAP connector:

* ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming)::
SAP's proprietary programming language and part of the NetWeaver platform for building business applications.

* ALE (Application Link Enabling)::
Technology for setting up and operating distributed applications. ALE facilitates distributed yet integrated installation of SAP systems. This involves business-driven message exchange using consistent data across loosely linked SAP applications. Applications are integrated through synchronous and asynchronous communication, rather than by use of a central database.

* BAPI (business application programming interface)::
The function module that fulfills design criteria, such as:
** Implements a method of a SAP business object.
** Maintains a static interface through different versions of the SAP system.
** Is remote-enabled.
** Runs to completion with or without user interaction.
** Handles errors.

* FM (function module)::
Function modules are procedures that are defined in the ABAP language of SAP. It allows the encapsulation and reuse of global functions in the SAP System.

* IDoc (Intermediate Document)::
Standard SAP format for electronic data interchange between SAP systems. Different message types (such as delivery notes or purchase orders) generally correspond to different special formats, known as IDoc types. Multiple message types with related content can, however, be assigned to a single IDoc type.

* Java API::
Handles dynamic metadata lookup and caching. It implements the `JCO.Function`, which is the container for parameters and/or tables for the SAP BAPI function module in Java. Java applications are built on top of the Java API.

* JNI (Java native interface)::
Originally, SAP created libraries in C language to allow direct RFC calls to SAP, to manipulate with data. JCo wraps C libraries in Java to provide platform-native access into the SAP system. RFC middleware uses RFC library through the JNI Layer.

* RFC (remote function call)::
Communication with the SAP system is performed over the RFC protocol. RFC means calling BAPI or triggering IDoc processing that runs in another system as calling program. The RFC interface enables function calls between two SAP systems or between the SAP and external system.

* RFC Layer::
SAP component that processes RFC calls.

* RFC Library::
Libraries of C language-based functions to access the SAP system. RFC library is addressed by JNI.

* SAP Java IDoc class library::
Provides structured, high-level interpretation and navigation of SAP IDocs in Java that consists of the following add-on packages:
** SAP Java base IDoc class library: a middleware-independent library that provides a set of general base classes and interfaces for middleware dependent Java IDoc class library implementations.
** SAP Java connector IDoc class library: A middleware-independent library for creating, sending, and receiving IDocs.

* SAP NetWeaver::
One of the main technologies and application platforms used by SAP solutions. Its main component is the SAP Web Application Server (WebAS), which provides the runtime environment for SAP applications like ERP, CRM, SCM, PLM, SRM, and BI. Other components include enterprise portal, exchange infrastructure, master data management, and mobile infrastructure. SAP NetWeaver is an umbrella term for these technical components. SAP NetWeaver runs on both Java and ABAP stacks.
