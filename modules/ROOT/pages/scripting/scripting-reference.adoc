The Scripting module executes custom logic written in a scripting language.

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::mule-runtime/module-scripting.adoc[Scripting Module Release Notes]


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Default Configuration


Default configuration


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x

== Operations

[[execute]]
=== Execute

`<scripting:execute>`


Run a script with provided code, according to the engine and passing parameters.  The script will have available a bunch of bindings variables to work with:

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^80%", options="header"]
|===
| Name              | Type                  | Description
| payload            | Object                | The payload of the message being processed.
| dataType           |                       | Data type of the message payload.
| correlationId      | String                | The correlationId of the message being processed.
| attributes         | Map<String, Object>   | Attributes of the Mule message being processed.
| vars               | Map<String, Object>   | The variables that are set on the current Mule event being processed.
| message            |                       | The message being processed.
| error              |                       | Error associated with the mule message being processed.
| authentication     |                       | Information about the authentication.
| flow               | String                | The name of the current flow.
| log                | Logger                | Logger object that logs to the app's log file, `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`
| result             | Object                | Variable representing the result of the script execution.  If the code doesn't produce an implicit result, you have to set explicitly this variable with the execution result.  The payload will be set with this value unless you have configured a xref:mule-runtime::target-variables.adoc[Target Variable] as described in xref:scripting::scripting-module.adoc[the scripting module documentation].
| registry | org.mule.runtime.api.artifact.Registry | The Registry object can be used to access any other service within the Mule API.
|===

Let's assume that we have a flow whose XML looks like as follow:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
....
<set-variable variableName="increment" value="#[22]" />
.....
<scripting:execute doc:name="Script" engine="nashorn">
    <scripting:code>
        log.info("Incrementing payload by " + (vars.increment + initialValue))
        result = vars.increment + Number(payload) + initialValue
    </scripting:code>
    <scripting:parameters><![CDATA[#[{ initialValue: 10 }]]]></scripting:parameters
</scripting:execute>
----

In the above example we can see:

* how to use a flow varible in our scripting code: `vars.increment``,
* how to use scripting parameters: just referencing them, like `initialValue`,
* how to log in some information by using the `log` variable: `log.info("....")`, and 
* how to use the `result` variable to set the result of the execution.  After the `scripting:execute` operation the payload will be set as defined in `vars.increment + Number(payload) + initialValue`

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Code a| String |  the script source code to be executed |  |x
| Engine a| String |  name of the scripting engine for running ths script |  |x
| Parameters a| Map<String, Object> |  variables provided to the script as bindings |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which the operation's output will be placed |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression that will be evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression will be stored in the target variable |  #[payload] |
|===

IMPORTANT: The classes used with the Scripting Module must be exported, if not the execution will fail with a SCRIPTING:COMPILATION error. See xref:mule-runtime::how-to-export-resources.adoc[How to export resources].

==== Throws
* SCRIPTING:COMPILATION
* SCRIPTING:UNKNOWN_ENGINE
* SCRIPTING:EXECUTION
