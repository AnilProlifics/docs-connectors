[[config]]
=== Default Configuration

==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x

 | The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| (DEPRECATED) Default write encoding a| String |  This parameter is deprecated and not taken into account. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. If no value is provided, the check will not be performed. When enabled, Mule waits the specified time between calls and performs two size checks. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. This attribute works in tandem with `#timeBetweenSizeCheckUnit`. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration, is one of:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS |  A TimeUnit that qualifies the `#timeBetweenSizeCheck` attribute. + Defaults to `MILLISECONDS`. | `MILLISECONDS` | 
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. Mule runtime engine purges the instances when it sees it fit. |  |

== Operations

[[copy]]
=== Copy
`<sftp:copy>`

Copies the file at the `sourcePath` into the `targetPath`. 

If `targetPath` doesn't exist, and neither does its parent, then an attempt is made to create a parent folder depending on the value of the `createParentFolder` argument. If `createParentFolder` is set to `false`, then an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error is thrown. 

If the overwrite argument is set to `true` and the target file already exists, then the target file is overwritten. Otherwise, an `SFTP:FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS` error is thrown. 

The `sourcePath` can be either a file or a directory. If it points to a directory, then it is copied recursively.

* SFTP:CONNECTIVITY 


[[read]]
=== Read
`<sftp:read>`


Obtains the content and metadata of a file at a given path. The operation itself returns a message whose payload is an `InputStream` with the file's content, and the metadata is represented as an `SftpFileAttributes` object that's placed as the message `Message#getAttributes()` attributes. 

If the lock parameter is set to `true`, then a file system level lock will be placed on the file until the input stream this operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Because the lock is provided by the host file system, its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule is running. Take that into consideration before relying on this lock. 

This method also makes a best effort to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension will be used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. You also have the chance to force the output encoding and `mimeType` through the `outputEncoding` and `outputMimeType` optional parameters.

[[write]]
=== Write
`<sftp:write>`


Writes the content into the file the path points to. 

If the directory to which the file is attempting to be written doesn't exist, then the operation will either throw an `SFTP:ILLEGAL_PATH` error, or create a new folder, depending on the value of `the createParentDirectory`. If the file already exists, then the behavior depends on the supplied mode. 

This operation also supports locking depending on the value of the lock argument, and follows the same rules and considerations as described in the read operation.

== Sources

[[listener]]
=== On New or Updated File
`<sftp:listener>`

Polls a directory and looks for files that have been created in it. One message is generated for each file that is found. 

The key part of this functionality is how to determine that a file is actually new. There are three strategies for that: 

* Set the `autoDelete` parameter to `true` to delete each file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be necessarily new.
* Set the `moveToDirectory` parameter to move each file to a different directory after it is processed, which achieves the same effect as `autoDelete` but without losing the file.
* Use the `watermarkMode` parameter to pick only files that have been created or updated after the last poll was executed.

You can also use a matcher for additional filtering of files.


==== Parameters
[%header,cols="20s,20a,35a,20a,5a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Configuration | String | The name of the configuration to use. | | x
| Directory a| String |  The directory in which polled files are contained. |  | 
| Recursive a| Boolean |  Whether or not to also poll files contained in sub directories. |  true | 
| Matcher a| <<matcher>> |  A matcher used to filter events on files that do not meet the matcher's criteria. |  | 
| Watermark Enabled a| Boolean |  Controls whether or not to do watermarking, and if so, if the watermark should consider the file's modification or creation timestamps. |  false | 
| Time Between Size Check a| Number |  Wait time (in milliseconds) between size checks to determine if a file is ready to be read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. You can disable this feature by omitting a value. When enabled, Mule performs two size checks, waiting the specified time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. |  | 
| Time Between Size Check Unit a| Enumeration is one of:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS |  A TimeUnit which qualifies the `#timeBetweenSizeCheck` attribute. |  | 
| Output Mime Type a| String |  The MIME type of the payload that this operation outputs. |  | 
| Output Encoding a| String |  The encoding of the payload that this operation outputs. |  | 
| Primary Node Only a| Boolean |  Whether this source should be executed only on the primary node when running in Cluster. |  |

* <<repeatable-file-store-stream>>
* <<non-repeatable-stream>> |  Configure whether to use repeatable streams and their behavior. |  | 
| Redelivery Policy a| <<RedeliveryPolicy>> |  Defines a policy for processing the redelivery of the same message. |  | 
| Reconnection Strategy a| * <<reconnect>>
* <<reconnect-forever>> |  A retry strategy in case of connectivity errors. |  | 
| Auto Delete a| Boolean |  Whether to delete each file after processing. |  false | 
| Move To Directory a| String |  If provided, each processed file will be moved to a directory that is pointed to by this path. |  | 
| Rename To a| String |  This parameter works in tandem with `moveToDirectory`. Use this parameter to enter the name of the directory under which to move the file. Do not set this parameter if `moveToDirectory` hasn't also been set. |  | 
| Apply Post Action When Failed a| Boolean |  Whether any of the post actions (`autoDelete` and `moveToDirectory`) should also be applied in case the file fails to be processed. If set to `false`, no failed files will be moved or deleted. |  true |

| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size will be expanded if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than the specified maximum is used, then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration is one of:

* BYTE
* KB
* MB
* GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed then content is buffered on the disk.  |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

* BYTE
* KB
* MB
* GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |

[[RedeliveryPolicy]]
=== Redelivery Policy

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Redelivery Count a| Number | The maximum number of times a message can be redelivered and processed unsuccessfully before triggering process-failed-message |  | 
| Use Secure Hash a| Boolean | Whether to use a secure hash algorithm to identify a redelivered message |  | 
| Message Digest Algorithm a| String | The secure hashing algorithm to use. If not set, the default is `SHA-256`. |  | 
| Id Expression a| String | Defines one or more expressions to use to determine when a message has been redelivered. This property may only be set if useSecureHash is false. |  | 
| Object Store a| <<ObjectStore>> | The object store where the `redelivery` counter for each message will be stored. |  |

[[repeatable-in-memory-iterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | This is the number of instances initially allowed to be kept in memory in order to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then it will be expanded according to the `bufferSizeIncrement` attribute, with an upper limit of `maxInMemorySize`. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | How much the buffer size will expand if it exceeds its initial specified size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, and that a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | This is the maximum amount of memory to use. If more than the maximum amount is used, then a `STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED` error will be raised. A value lower or equal to zero means no limit. |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-iterable]]
=== Repeatable File Store Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | This is the maximum number of instances to keep in memory. If more than the maximum number of instances is required, then it will start to buffer the content on disk. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration is one of:

* BYTE
* KB
* MB
* GB | The unit in which `maxInMemorySize` is expressed. |  |
