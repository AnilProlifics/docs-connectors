The Flow Designer feature of Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, 
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have 
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. 
For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Flow Designer field values, see 
the xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-reference.adoc[Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

Create an app in Flow Designer based on what input source you want for the app. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector enables
you to have your app receive input when objects are created or modified. Alternatively, you can set up an input source using HTTP, or at timed intervals using Scheduler.

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application* to open Flow Designer.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the trigger card.
. Select *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector* and select your input source as either *On New Object* or *On Modified Object*. 
. Complete these required fields depending on the operation:
+
[%header,cols="30a,20s,50a"]
|===
|Operation |Field |Description
|On New Object | |Start app when an object is created.
| |Entity Type |Describe business data as defined in a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance.
Examples are `account` and `contact`.
| |*Connection* > *Connection* | Connect to an OAuth server using an authorization URL and access token URL
| |(If Connection) - *Resource* |Resource URL for accessing the Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance
| |(If Connection) - *Consumer Key* |OAuth consumer key registered with the service provider
| |(If Connection) - *Consumer Secret* |OAuth consumer secret registered with the service provider
| |(If Connection) - *Listener Config* |A reference to an to use to create the listener to catch the access token callback endpoint
| |(If Connection) - *Callback Path* |The path of the access token callback endpoint
| |(If Connection) - *Authorize Path* |The path of the local HTTP endpoint that triggers the OAuth dance
| |*Connection* > *OAuth Username Password* |Connect using a user name and password that you specify
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Username* |User name used to initialize the session
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Password* |Password used to authenticate against the proxy
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Resource* |The Application ID URI of the web API's secured resource
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Client ID* |The Application ID assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure AD. You can find this in the Azure Portal. Click Active Directory, click the directory, choose the application, and click Configure.
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Client Secret* |The app secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. It should not be used in a native app, because client secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices. It is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the client secret securely on the server side.
| |(If OAuth Username Password) - *Token Request Endpoint* |URL of the OAuth token request server.
