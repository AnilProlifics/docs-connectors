Microsoft Dynamics 365 Connector v2.3.1

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365 enables integration with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Cloud API.

This connector enables you to perform operations to:

* Authorize or unauthorize server access.
* Create, update, and delete entities.
* Retrieve a single entity or query multiple entities.
* Associate and disassociate entities.
* Execute actions.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics 365, ServiceNow,
and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 target resource and 
Anypoint Platform. You also need understand how to create a Mule app using 
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

Obtain a client ID and secret for your app by logging into the Microsoft Azure Active Directory portal at portal.azure.com.

Before starting:

* You need access to a Microsoft Dynamics 365 instance leveraged by Azure Active Directory; that is, Azure Active Directory is the Identity Provider that provides access to an application.

== Audience

* Starting user -- To create your Mule app,
see xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center Configuration]
or xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Studio Configuration]. The
xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic provides one or more use cases for using the connector.
* Power user - Read the xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-xml-maven.adoc[XML and Maven Support] and xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topics.

== Connector Terminology

* Actions - Operations that allow side effects, such as data modification, cannot be further composed to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
* Complex types - Keyless named structured types consisting of a set of properties. Complex types are commonly used as property values in model entities, or as parameters or return values for operations.
* Entities - Instances of entity types, for example, an account or an opportunity.
* Entity sets - Named collections of entities, for example, an account is an entity set containing account entities. An entity's key uniquely identifies the entity within an entity set.
* Entity types - Named structured types with a key. Entity types define the named properties and relationships of an entity, and may derive by single inheritance from other entity types.
* Enumeration types or enum types - Named primitive types whose values are named constants with underlying integer values.
* Functions - Operations that do not have side effects and may support further composition, for example, with additional filter operations, functions, or an action.

== Common Use Cases For the Connector

The following use cases are described in the xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-examples.adoc[Examples] topic.

* Create an account with attributes that associate an account with a contact.
* Create an empty contact entity.
* Create an empty opportunity entity.
* Create multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request.
* Delete an entity by type.
* Disassociate keys based on an identity ID.
* Retrieve an entity by type.
* Retrieve multiple entities using a URL request.
* Retrieve multiple entities using DataSense query language.
* Update an account with attributes.
* Update multiple entities of the same type in a single batch request.

== Input Sources (Triggers)

Anypoint Connector for Microsoft Dynamics 365 enables you to start an app using these input sources:

* On New Object - Start your app when an object is created.
* On Modified Object - Start your app when an object is modified.

== Next Step

After you have met the prerequisites and experimented with templates and examples, you are ready to create an app with
xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-design-center.adoc[Design Center] or xref:microsoft/microsoft-dynamics-365-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
