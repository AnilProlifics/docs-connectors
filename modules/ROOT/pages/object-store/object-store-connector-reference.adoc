Object Store v0.8.1

+++
Connector that provides functionality to access and create Object Store instances.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | |x
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | |x
|===

== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
=== Connection

+++
A ConnectionProvider which returns the runtime's default ObjectStoreManager.
+++

==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment fails if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|===

== Operations

[[clear]]
== Clear

`<os:clear>`

+++
Removes all the contents in the store.
+++

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Object Store a| String |  +++A reference to the ObjectStore to be used. If not defined, the runtime's default partition will be used.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|===

=== Throws

* OS:STORE_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE {nbsp}

[[contains]]
== Contains

`<os:contains>`

+++
Checks if there is any value associated to the given key. If no value exist for the key, then false is returned. 

This operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation is able to access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across the nodes.
+++

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++Key to locate in the object store.+++ |  |x
| Object Store a| String |  +++A reference to the ObjectStore to be used. If not defined, the runtime's default partition will be used+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable in which the operation's output is placed.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable.+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
|===

=== Output

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Type | Boolean
|===

=== Throws

* OS:STORE_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE {nbsp}
* OS:INVALID_KEY {nbsp}

[[remove]]
== Remove

`<os:remove>`

+++
Removes the value associated with the given key. If no value exists for the key, then a OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND error is thrown. 

This operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation is able to access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running in cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across the nodes.
+++

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the object to be removed.+++ |  |x
| Object Store a| String |  +++A reference to the ObjectStore to be used. If not defined, the runtime's default partition is used.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|===

=== Throws

* OS:STORE_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE {nbsp}
* OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:INVALID_KEY {nbsp}


[[retrieve]]
== Retrieve

`<os:retrieve>`

Retrieves the value stored for the given key.

If no value exists for the key, behavior depends on the defaultValue parameter:

* If the parameter isn't provided or it resolves to a null value, then an OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND error is thrown.
* If the parameter is provided and doesn't resolve to a null value, the defaultValue is returned, but not stored.

This operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation is able to access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running on cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across the nodes.

=== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Key a| String |  +++The key of the value to be retrieved.+++ |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Default Value a| Any |  +++Value to be returned if the key doesn't exist in the store.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Object Store a| String |  +++A reference to the ObjectStore to be used. If not defined, the runtime's default partition will be used.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Variable a| String |  +++The name of a variable in which the operation's output is placed.+++ |  | {nbsp}
| Target Value a| String |  +++An expression to evaluate against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable.+++ |  +++#[payload]+++ | {nbsp}
|===

=== Output

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Type | Any
|===

=== Throws

* OS:STORE_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:STORE_NOT_AVAILABLE {nbsp}
* OS:KEY_NOT_FOUND {nbsp}
* OS:INVALID_KEY {nbsp}

[[store]]
== Store

`<os:store>`

+++
Stores the given value using the given key. 

This operation can be used either for storing new values or updating existing ones, depending on the value of the failIfPresent. When that parameter is set to false (default value) then any pre existing value associated to that key will be overwritten. If the parameter is set to true, then a OS:KEY_ALREADY_EXISTS error will be thrown instead. 

Another important consideration is regarding null values. It is not allowed to store a null value. However, a common use case is to obtain a value (most likely by evaluating a expression or transformation), testing the value for not null, storing it if present and doing nothing otherwise. The failOnNullValue parameter simplifies this use case. On its default value of true, a OS:NULL_VALUE error is thrown if a null value is supplied. However, when set to false, a null value causes this operation to do nothing, no error is raised and no value is altered either. 

Finally, this operation is synchronized on the key level. No other operation is able to access the same key on the same object store while this operation is running. If the runtime is running on cluster mode, this synchronization is also guaranteed across the nodes.

| Fail On Null Value a| Boolean |  +++Whether to fail or skip the operation if the value is null.+++ |  +++true+++ | {nbsp}
