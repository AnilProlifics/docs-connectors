== Changes in Connection Providers

This release contains the following changes:

* Removed the connection providers that used the pooling connection, which were deprecated

Four operations were removed from the Salesforce connector and are available in the new connector.

//[cols="15%,35%,15%]
|===
3+|Removed in Salesforce 10.x
|Name	|Reason for removal|Functionality covered by

| Create single | The Create operation can be used with a single record if needed. |Create
| Create multiple | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult in order to be integrated with the Batch scope, but now the Create operation returns the same type. |Create
| Create bulk | This operation makes no sense as it simple creates a job with a certain operation and afterwards it uploads a batch in that job. | Create Job with INSERT operation parameter + Create Batch
| Update single	| The Update operation can be used with a single record if needed.| Update
| Update multiple | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult in order to be integrated with the Batch scope, but now the Update operation returns the same type. |Update
| Update bulk | This operation makes no sense as it simple creates a job with a certain operation and afterwards it uploads a batch in that job. | Create Job with UPDATE operation parameter + Create Batch
| Upsert multiple | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult in order to be integrated with the Batch scope, but now the Upsert operation returns the same type. |Upsert
| Upsert bulk | This operation makes no sense as it simple creates a job with a certain operation and afterwards it uploads a batch in that job. | Create Job with UPSERT operation parameter + Create Batch
| Delete multiple | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult in order to be integrated with the Batch scope, but now the Update operation returns the same type. |Delete
| Hard delete bulk | This operation makes no sense as it simple creates a job with a certain operation and afterwards it uploads a batch in that job. | Create Job with HARD DELETE operation parameter + Create Batch
| Query single | The Query operation can be used to return a single entity by using LIMIT 1.| Query
| Non paginated query | The runtime already returns all the results for the Query operation so this operation is not useful. | Query
| Get updated objects | This operation was removed since the initialTimeWindow parameter did not made much sense. | Get updated objects + Retrieve
| Get updated | This operation was removed since it was providing the same functionality as Get Updated Range operation with some small differences in input parameters. | Get updated objects
| Get deleted range | This operation was removed as it made not much sense since it was providing the same functionality as Get Deleted with some small differences in input parameters. | Get deleted objects
| Create bulk for query | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result | Create batch for query
| Create multiple bulk | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result | Create Job with CREATE operation parameter + Create Batch
| Update multiple bulk | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result | Create Job with UPDATE operation parameter + Create Batch
| Upsert multiple bulk | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result | Create Job with UPSERT operation parameter + Create Batch
| Hard delete multiple | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result | Create Job with HARD DELETE operation parameter + Create Batch
| Create multiple batch | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result| Create batch
| Create multiple batch stream |  This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result| Create batch stream
| Bulk result | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result.| Batch result
| Bulk result stream| This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result. Now the Batch result stream operation returns an input stream that can be split into batches and processed using the Batch scope if desired. |Batch result stream
| Bulk info | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result| Batch info
| Query multiple result stream | This operation was returning a BulkOperationResult but it makes no sense to integrate it with the Batch Scope since it only returns a single result. Now the Query result stream operation returns an input stream that can be split into batches and processed using the Batch scope if desired.| Query result stream

== Upgrade Steps

. Create a backup of your files, data, and configuration in case you need to restore to the previous version.
. Follow these steps to perform the upgrade to Salesforce Connector 10.0.0:

.. In Studio, create a Mule project.
.. In the Mule Palette view, click *Search in Exchange*.
.. In Add Modules to Project, type 'Salesforce 10' in the search field.
.. In Available modules, select *Salesforce Connector 10.0.0*, and then click *Add*.
.. Click *Finish*.
.. Verify that the `salesforce-connector` dependency version is `10.0.0` in the pom.xml.

Anypoint Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to verify the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Check the project pom.xml and verify that there are no problems.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and caching the metadata, try restarting Anypoint Studio.

== Reverting the Upgrade

If it is necessary to revert to the previous version of Salesforce Connector, change the `salesforce-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the project's pom.xml to the previous version.

You must update the project's pom.xml in Anypoint Studio.
