Salesforce Marketing Connector Version 3.0.0

Release Notes: xref:release-notes::connector/salesforce-marketing-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Salesforce Marketing Connector Release Notes]

The Anypoint Connector for Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Salesforce Marketing Cloud Connector) lets you connect to the Marketing Cloud API, which is also called Salesforce Marketing Cloud. This connector exposes convenient operations for using the capabilities of Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Mule, Anypoint Connectors, Anypoint Studio, Mule concepts, elements in a Mule flow, and global elements.

You need login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For hardware and software requirements and compatibility
information, see the Connector Release Notes.

To use this connector with Maven, view the `pom.xml` dependency information in the Dependency Snippets section in Anypoint Exchange.

== What's New in this Connector

Each operation now returns a map instead of a POJO. The map is a representation of the old POJO, with each POJO field name as a key and each POJO field value as a value.

== Known Issues and Limitations

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector has some limitations when working with subclasses inside complex fields, trying to retrieve fields from a hierarchy, or attempting to return an Automation object.

=== Working with Subclasses inside Complex Fields

Some objects in Salesforce Marketing Cloud have complex fields, such as the Recurrence field, which belong to a base class. DataSense can only bring up fields specific to the base class.

To use additional fields that belong to a subclass of a base class, manually add the desired fields to the Transform Message component. For Salesforce Marketing Cloud to know that you want to work with a subclass and recognize the fields you added, you must also add a field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

See <<salesforce/salesforce-mktg-connector#providing-subclass,Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field>> for an example detailing how to achieve this.

=== Retrieving Fields From a Hierarchy

The Retrieve operation allows you to retrieve records in a SQL query-like fashion. When you use the Retrieve operation, Salesforce Marketing Cloud prevents the retrieval of fields that are part of a hierarchy. For example, the Subscriber object has a complex structure:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-subscriber-structure.png[subscriber structure]

The API only allows you to query fields on the first level, such as EmailAddress or SubscriberKey, but not fields like Attributes.Name.

=== Server Results Containing an Automation Object

Server results that contain an Automation object cause an exception to be thrown. When performing an operation, such as Create or Delete, on an Automation object, the returned result contains the structure of the Automation object you acted upon. The server also returns an additional field in the Automation object called isPlatformObject that is not recognized by the WSDL.

To bypass this issue, make all operations that directly use an Automation object asynchronous. If an operation is asynchronous, the immediate response of the operation is `Operation Queued`.

For more information, see the <<salesforce/salesforce-mktg-connector#asynchronous-operations,Asynchronous Operations>>.

== Common Use Cases

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector supports these common use cases:

* Configure Create - Calls the Configure command with Create as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Configure Delete - Calls the Configure command with Delete as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Configure Update - Calls the Configure command with Update as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Create - Creates a new object on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Delete - Deletes an existing object on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Perform get max count - Calls the Perform command with GetMaxCount as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Perform start - Sends a Perform command having Start as an action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Perform stop - Sends a Perform command having Stop as an action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP Web service.
* Retrieve - Retrieves objects from the Marketing Cloud API web server in a SQL query-like fashion.
* Schedule start - Calls the Schedule command with Start as the action attribute when connected to the Marketing Cloud API SOAP web service.
* Update - Updates an existing object on the Marketing Cloud API web server.
* Upsert - Creates an object if the object does not already exist, or deletes an existing object on the Marketing Cloud API web server This operation is achieved by using Create method of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud SOAP API.

=== Add a Proxy

To use a proxy server the following system properties must be set at runtime:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Dhttp.proxyHost =<proxy host>

Dhttp.proxyPort=<proxy port>
----

If the proxy server is configured to require authentication, the following Java system properties must be set:

[source,text,linenums]
----
Dhttp.proxyUser=<proxy user>

Dhttp.proxyPassword=<proxy password>
----

=== [[providing-subclass]]Providing a Subclass as a Type to a Complex Field

Suppose your want to schedule an existing Automation that send emails to a subscriber list once per minute. To do this, add a Schedule Reference to the connector through a flow variable:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-schedule-start-automation.png[Schedule Start Automation]

Use the Recurrence field in ScheduleDefinition to provide information such as how much time should pass between emails sent. The Recurrence field is a complex field that has no structure.

To specify a MinutelyRecurrence instead of a Recurrence:

* Manually add the fields belonging to the MinutelyRecurrence class.

* Add an additional field called concreteClassType of type String whose value is the name of the subclass.

The mapping for the ScheduleDefinition looks like this in the example:

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-schedule-definition-transform-config.png[Schedule Definition]

This map has a field called minuteInterval that belongs to a subclass of Recurrence called MinutelyRecurrence.

For the connector to use the MinutelyRecurrence object, you must also add the concreteClassType field with `MinutelyRecurrence` as the value.

=== [[asynchronous-operations]]Asynchronous Operations

Most operations are synchronous by default, meaning that the connector waits for the result of the operation. For more details regarding the operations of the Marketing Cloud API, access the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Methods documentation.

To specify that you want an operation to behave asynchronously, use the Options parameter for the operation.

The following example creates a list of Automation objects to provide in the payload. Because the result of any operation that works directly with Automation objects throws an exception caused by the presence of an unknown field, the example uses the CreateOptions parameter to make the call asynchronous. In this example, the CreateOptions is provided in a variable called `vars`.

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-create-automation-config.png[Create Automation]

This mapping for CreateOptions in vars looks like this:

* The requestType field determines the type of call (SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNCHORONOUS).

* The conversationID field assigns a unique identifier to the asynchronous call.

You can group asynchronous calls together using the conversationID, callsInConversation, and sequenceCode fields. For example, suppose you want to make five asynchronous calls to the server, execute the calls together, and specify their execution order. To do this:

* Assign the same conversationID to each call.

* Set the callsInConversation field to 5.

* Use the sequenceCode field to order the calls.

The following example has a single call, so it passes a value of 1 to callsInConversation and sequenceCode.

image::salesforce/salesforce-mktg-as-create-automation-options.png[CreateOptions]

The Options parameter has more functionality that shown in this example. For more information, see the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Objects documentation.
