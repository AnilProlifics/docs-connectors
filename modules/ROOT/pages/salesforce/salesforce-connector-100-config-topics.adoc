Read this topic to obtain additional configuration and usage information for the Anypoint Connector for Salesforce (Salesforce Connector).

[[customevents]]
== Custom Event Notifications

Salesforce Connector enables you to obtain custom event notifications. These notifications apply to general events that are not tied to Salesforce data changes.

To obtain custom event notifications:

. Create a streaming channel by using the `Publish Streaming Channel` operation.
+
A StreamingChannel is a special Salesforce object that represents a channel used for notifying listeners of generic Streaming API events.
+
You can also create a streaming channel through Salesforce or https://workbench.developerforce.com/about.php[
workbench].
+
. Subscribe to the channel by using the `Subscribe Channel Listener` operation.
+
Salesforce Connector converts the custom events in your streaming channel to Mule events and sends them to your flows.

For more information about working with streaming channels, see <<streamingchanel,Create a Streaming Channel to Receive Data From Salesforce>> and <<receivedata,Receive Data From Salesforce>>.

[[eventsandtopics]]
== Events and Topics

Your app can receive events by subscribing to an existing Salesforce topic or by creating a new topic and then subscribing to it.

Each event that travels through your flow contains information about the Salesforce data that changed, including how the data changed and when the change occurred. The connector parses this information and sends your app the information.

Salesforce stores events for 24 hours. You can retrieve stored events during that retention window. A subscriber to a topic or channel can retrieve events at any time and is not restricted to listening to events at the time they are sent.

*Reviewers: the above paragraph is not clear. Does the subscriber have to retrieve events within 24 hours?*

Salesforce assigns each broadcast event a numeric ID. IDs are incremented and not guaranteed to be contiguous for consecutive events. For example, the event following the event with ID 999 can have an ID of 1025. A broadcast event ID is unique for the organization and channel. Salesforce does not reuse the IDs of deleted events.

For information on processing events when streaming data to an app from Salesforce, see <<Receive Data From Salesforce>>.

[[eventsreceive]]
=== Receive Events for a Topic

Before you can receive events for Salesforce changes associated with a topic, you must create the topic. When you create a topic, the connector creates a PushTopic, which is a special object in Salesforce that binds a name (in this case, the topic's name) and Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) query together. After you create a topic, you can subscribe to it by name.

You can use either the Create (`create`) or Publish Topic (`publish-topic`) operation to create a topic. The following example uses the `publish-topic` operation to create a topic:

`<sfdc:publish-topic name="AccountUpdates" query="SELECT Id, Name FROM Account"/>`

Alternatively, you can create a topic in Salesforce by executing code such as this code from an *Enter Apex Code* window, which is accessible through the system logs:

[source,text,linenums]
----
PushTopic pushTopic = new PushTopic();
pushTopic.ApiVersion = 23.0;
pushTopic.Name = 'AllAccounts';
pushTopic.Description = 'All records for the Account object';
pushTopic.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM Account';
insert pushTopic;
System.debug('Created new PushTopic: '+ pushTopic.Id);
----

[[topicsub]]
=== Subscribe to a Topic

After you create a Salesforce topic, you can start receiving events by subscribing to the topic. To do so, add the Subscribe Topic Listener (`subscribe-topic-listener`) or Replay Topic Listener (`replay-topic-listener`) as an input source trigger for your flow. The trigger acts as an inbound endpoint. Every time the subscription receives an event, the trigger executes the rest of the flow in your Mule app.

In the following XML example, Mule prints a message to the log at the INFO level:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="accountUpdatesSubscription">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:subscribe-topic-listener topic="AccountUpdates"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Received an event for Salesforce Object ID #[map-payload:Id]"/>
</flow>
----

You can subscribe to a topic that was not previously published in Salesforce. However, when the topic is later published, you will not receive notifications regarding that topic unless you resubscribe to it.

[[topicrep]]
=== Replay a Topic

A subscriber can specify which events to receive. By default, a subscribe receives only the events that occur after subscribing. Events outside the 24-hour retention period are discarded.

The Replay Topic Listener operation provides these options:

* `ALL`
+
Subscriber receives all events, including past events that are within the 24-hour retention period and new events sent after subscription.
* `ONLY_NEW`
+
Subscriber receives new events that are broadcast after the client subscribes.
* `FROM_REPLAY_ID`
+
Subscriber receives all events after the specified event `replayId`.

If you specify the `ALL` or `ONLY_NEW` replay option, the `replayId` value is ignored.

In Studio, the *Resume from the Last Replay Id* check box enables you to specify an automatic replay of stored events, based on the Replay ID of the last event processed by the connector. You can use this functionality when the connector stops listening, such as a during a server shutdown or dropped connection. If the stored Replay ID is outside the 24-hour retention period, the replay option determines what events to replay.

In the following XML example, the Replay Topic Listener acts like an inbound endpoint for the Logger component message:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="accountUpdatesReplay">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:replay-topic-listener topic="AccountUpdates" replayId="1" replayOption="ALL" autoReplay="true"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

[[pushdata]]
== Push Data to Salesforce

You can use Salesforce Connector as an outbound connector in your flow to push data to Salesforce. To use the connector in this capacity, place Salesforce Connector to the right of an inbound endpoint in your flow.

[[receivedata]]
== Receive Data From Salesforce

You can use Salesforce Connector as an inbound connector to stream data from Salesforce into your application. To use the connector in this capacity, place Salesforce Connector at the start of your flow and do not wrap it in a poll scope.

Studio automatically converts the connector to Salesforce Streaming mode, which accesses the Salesforce Streaming API. The converted connector can perform only the  *Subscribe Topic Listener* operation in this mode.

*Reviewers: Is *Subscribe Topic Listener* correct in the paragraph aboe=ve, or should this be *Subscribe Channel Listener?*

In this example, Salesforce Connector listens to notifications on a topic and feeds the data into the flow:

image::salesforce/salesforce-studio-subscribe-streaming-channel.png[subscribe streaming channel]

Streaming channels provide notifications that are not limited to record-based events to subscribers. You can use Salesforce Connector to work with Salesforce streaming channels.

For more information about streaming channels, see the https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_streaming.meta/api_streaming/intro_stream.htm[Salesforce Streaming API].

[[streamingchannel]]
== Create a Streaming Channel to Receive Data From Salesforce

To create a streaming channel, you must have the proper Salesforce Streaming API permissions enabled in your organization.

Follow these steps to create a streaming channel:

. Log in to your Salesforce Developer Edition organization.
. Under *All Tabs (+)*, select *Streaming Channels*.
. On the *Streaming Channels* tab, select *New* to create a new streaming channel.
. Enter `/u/notifications/ExampleUserChannel` in the *Streaming Channel Name* field.
. Enter an optional description.

*Reviewers: Where does the next paragraph fit in? Is it a step to perform after step 5 in the previous procedure?*

Use either the connector *Create* operation or the connector `publish-streaming-channel` operation to create a streaming channel. The following example uses the `publish-streaming-channel` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<sfdc:publish-streaming-channel
    name="/u/Notifications"
    description="General notifications"/>
----

[[streamsub]]
== Subscribe to a Streaming Channel

After you create a streaming channel, you can start receiving events by subscribing to the channel. The `subscribe-channel-listener` acts like an inbound endpoint. In this example, every time a subscription to `/u/TestStreaming` receives an event, it executes the rest of the flow and logs a message at the INFO level:
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="notificationsChannelSubscription">
  <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
  <sfdc:subscribe-channel-listener streamingChannel="/u/TestStreaming"/>
  <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
  <logger level="INFO" message="Received an event: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

The *Streaming Channel* field of the Subscribe Channel Listener operation does not display change events that are available in the Salesforce environment, because this information is not provided in the Salesforce API. However, your connector can subscribe to a streaming channel to obtain this information. For example, to subscribe to the `All Change Events` channel, use `/data/ChangeEvents` as the channel name to which you subscribe.

For more information, see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.change_data_capture.meta/change_data_capture/cdc_subscribe_channels.htm[Subscription Channels] in the Salesforce Change Data Capture Developer Guide.

=== Streaming Channel Inbound Properties

This information gets passed along as inbound properties:

* `channel` maps to the Channel JSON property.
* `type` maps to the Type JSON property in data.
* `createdDate` maps to the createdDate JSON property in data.

Except for `channel`, each property inside an event is available as an inbound property.

// This does not make sense.

=== Replay Events from a Streaming Channel

A streaming channel can replay notifications. The `replay-channel-listener` input source acts like an inbound endpoint and you can use it as shown in the following example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flowStreamingChannelReplay">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:replay-channel-listener streamingChannel="/u/Notifications" replayId="1" replayOption="ALL"/>
    <!-- REST OF YOUR FLOW -->
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

If you specify the `ALL` or `ONLY_NEW` replay options, the `replayId` value is ignored.

=== Push Events to a Streaming Channel

Salesforce lets you push custom events to a specific streaming channel through the REST API. To do this, use https://workbench.developerforce.com/about.php[workbench] or this connector.

To use the `push-generic-event` operation:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="flowPushGenericEvent">
    <!-- INBOUND ENDPOINT -->
    <sfdc:push-generic-event channelId="0M6j0000000KyjBCAS">
      <sfdc:events>
            <sfdc:event payload="Notification message text"/>
        </sfdc:events>
  </sfdc:push-generic-event>
    <logger level="INFO" message="Replayed events: #[payload]"/>
</flow>
----

You can retrieve the channel ID from the response map of the `publish-streaming-channel` operation. Alternatively, you can retrieve the channel ID from the Salesforce page:

. Log in to your Developer Edition organization.
. Under *All Tabs (+)*, select *Streaming Channels*.

If the channel ID field is not visible on the channel list, follow these steps:

. Click *Create New View*.
. Type a name for the view in the *Name* input field.
. In the *Available Fields* list, select *Streaming Channel ID* and click *Add*.
+
You should see the channel ID for each streaming channel in the list.
+
. Add any other fields.
. Click *Save*.

The JSON received as a response from the push event operation looks something like this:

[source,json,linenums]
----
[
  {
  "userOnlineStatus": {
  },
  "fanoutCount": 0
  }
]
----

[[batchdata]]
== Load Data in Batches

The Salesforce Bulk API loads batches of your organization's data into Salesforce. Salesforce Connector provides the Create and Create Bulk operations for working with the Bulk API.

For all bulk operations, Salesforce handles the creation process in the background. The connector replies with a BatchInfo object, which contains the ID of the batch and the ID of the job it creates to upload the objects.

// Find out which objects this refers to

In Salesforce, you can track the status of bulk data load jobs and their associated batches by using the job ID for the Bulk Data Load Jobs:

. Click YOUR_NAME > *Setup* > *Monitoring* > *Bulk Data Load Jobs*.
. Click the job ID to view the job detail page.

The job detail page includes a related list of all the batches for the job. The related list provides `View Request` and `View Response` links for each batch. If the batch is a CSV file, the links return the request or response in CSV format. If the batch is an XML file, the links return the request or response in XML format.

[[leadconvert]]
== Specify a Lead Convert Request ID

To specify a lead ID for a `LeadConvertRequest` operation, use a DataWeave transform message. When you use a transform message before the operation, you must add the `leadId` field, because the metadata for the operation doesn't specify it:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<ee:transform doc:name="Transform Message" >
            <ee:message >
                <ee:set-payload ><![CDATA[%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
{
    leadId: "LEAD_ID",
    accountId: "ACCOUNT_ID",
    convertedStatus: "Closed - Converted",
    doNotCreateOpportunity: true
} as Object {
    class : "org.mule.extension.salesforce.api.core.LeadConvertRequest"
}]]></ee:set-payload>
            </ee:message>
</ee:transform>
----

[[usagenotes]]
== Usage Notes

=== Fields To Null

The configurations have a checkbox called *Can Clear Fields by Updating Field Value to Null*. If checked, all the fields in a request that have a Null value are added to the `fieldsToNull` field and sent to Salesforce.

You can decide which fields to set to Null without being forced to use the `fieldsToNull` field.

=== Upsert

Unless you configure the External ID Field Name for the sObject to which you are trying to upsert, every use of the upsert fails.

The upsert operation does not work with the sObject `priceBookentry2`.

A;through you can't change the `contentType` for bulk upsert, you can use the `Create Job` operation to set the contentType to either CSV or zipped CSV (if you're near the character limit). Follow up with the `Create Batch` operation.

=== Query

Although you can see the fields of an sObject and their corresponding types via DataSense, the `Query` operation returns all fields as `String`.

To use the actual type of the field, use a Transform or Transform Message component to convert the field to the desired type.

Although `CreatedDate` field appears as `dateTime`, the query returns a `String` that represents the date. To use the field as a `dateTime` field, configure it using Transform Message.

To store `Date` and `dateTime` fields, use DataWeave expressions to create `Date` and `Calendar` Java objects.

=== Invoke APEX Rest Method

The Invoke APEX Rest operation enables users to invoke a method from an Apex class that is exposed as a REST service. The following example shows a payload for this operation:

[source,example,linenums]
----
<ee:transform doc:name="Transform Message">
			<ee:message >
				<ee:set-payload ><![CDATA[output application/java
---
{
	body: {
		URLParameters: {
			Parameter1: "parameter1Value",
			Parameter2: "parameter2Value"
		},
		account: {
			Name: "Example",
			AccountNumber: "55"
		}
	},
	headers: {
		header1:"header1Value"
	},
	cookies: {
		cookie1:"cookie1Value"
	},
	queryParameters: {
		queryParam1Name:"queryParam1Value",
		queryParam2Name:"queryParam2Value"
	}
}]]></ee:set-payload>
			</ee:message>
		</ee:transform>
----

In this example:

* The `body` element contains `URLParameters`, which is a map containing the parameters that replace the wildcards in the path of the REST resource described in the Apex class.
+
For example if the REST resource is set to `@RestResource(urlMapping='/myResource/\*/mySubResource/*')`, the value of `Parameter1` replaces the first `\*`, and the value of `Parameter2` replaces the second `*`.
* Key names must start with `Parameter` followed by a number that shows the position of the `*` to be replaced.
+
* After the `URLParameters` block, provide the content of the `body` to send to the REST resource, as shown in the example `account` block.
* The `headers` and `cookies` fields describe the headers and cookies to pass along with the HTTP request to the desired service.
* The `queryParameters` field describes the query parameters to use, and the keys and values in this map that the specified Apex Class must accept.

=== Insert Values in a Salesforce Drop-Down Menu

Inserting dependent values into an existing drop-down menu in Salesforce does not always work. Test to confirm this functionality.

=== Evaluate Values in a Salesforce Drop-Down Menu

If you are evaluating against a value in an existing drop-down list field in Salesforce, use the exact value in the drop-down list. For example, if you use the value `US` to evaluate against the contents of a drop-down list that contains the value `USA`, the evaluation works, but the result is two values in the drop-down list: one for `US` and one for `USA`.

=== Currency

Currency values cannot exceed 18 characters in length.

When working with multiple currencies, be aware of which currency your sObject uses so that you avoid inaccurate entries. The default currency matches the location at the organization level.

=== Limits on API Calls

You must know the rate limiting policy that applies to your account so that you do not exceed the number of allotted API calls per day.

=== Opportunity Object

When extracting data from an `Opportunity`, be aware that a "quarter" in this context is relative to the financial year of the organization instead of relative to the calendar year.
