. Create a flow with an HTTP Listener, set its Path to *requests* and the Allowed Methods field to GET.
. Create a Global Element for the Listener, set Host to `localhost`, leave the Port as the default `8081` and set the Base Path to `mypath`.
. Add another building block, such as a Logger, after the HTTP Listener. Set the Logger *Message* to `flow 1`.
. Create a second flow with an HTTP Listener. Ensure that the *Connector Configuration* field is set to the `HTTP_Listener_Config` global element you created for the first connector.
. Set *Path* to `requests`. In the properties editor, click *Advanced* and set *Allowed methods* to `POST`.
. Add a Logger after the HTTP Listener. Set the Logger *Message* to `flow 2`.
. Using a browser extension such as Postman, send HTTP GET and POST requests to `+http://localhost:8081/mypath/requests+`.
+
The GET request response is `flow 1`. The POST request response is `flow 2`.
+
. Send a DELETE request.
+
The `405 Method Not Allowed` message is returned because DELETE is not an allowed method.
