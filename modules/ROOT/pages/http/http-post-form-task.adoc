The following example shows an HTTP request by posting a form. Learn how to perform this operation by creating a Mule app using Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) listener operation, both in Studio and XML. Additionally, review how to send the HTTP request that contains form parameters using an API tool such as Postman or Curl.

== Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. To create a new flow, add an HTTP Listener Connector into the canvas, set *Path* to `submitform`.
. Go to the *Global Elements* tab, and click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* filter box, search and select HTTP Listener config. Click *OK*.
. Set *Host* to `localhost` and *Port* as the default value of `8081`. Click *OK*.
. Return to the Message flow and after the HTTP Connector, add a Choice router.
. On the first choice of the router, add a Set Payload element. Set its value field to the following expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
Sorry #[payload.'firstname'], you're too young to register.
----

+
Note that this expression refers to one of the form parameters included in the request: `firstname`. After being received by the connector, it exists in the mule message payload as an item in a map.
. On the Choice router, configure the *When* condition for that path to be the following expression:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
#[server.dateTime.year-18 < payload.'yearborn']
----

+
Once again, this expression refers to one of the incoming form parameters, `yearborn`.
. Complete the flow by adding another Set Payload element in the *Default* path of the Choice router. Set its value field to:
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
Registration has been carried out successfully! Welcome #[payload.'firstname'] #[payload.'lastname']!
----

+

== XML Editor

. Create an `<http:listener>` global configuration, set *host* to `localhost` and *port* to `8081`.
. Create a flow with an `<http:listener>` connector. Reference your connector to the global element you just created, set *path* to `submitform`.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" doc:name="HTTP Listener Configuration"/>

    <flow name="RegisterUser">
        <http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="submitform" doc:name="HTTP"/>

    </flow>
----

. After the HTTP Connector, add a `choice` router with two alternative paths. Set the first path to execute when the following MEL expression is true:
+

[source,text,linenums]
----
#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']
----

+
Note that `yearborn` is one of the form parameters that is expected from incoming requests.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']">

            </when>
            <otherwise>

            </otherwise>
        </choice>
----

. Add a `set-payload` element on each alternative path, one to return a rejection notice and the other to return a success message. In both 'set-payload' elements, refer to the fields of the incoming form parameters to construct the message.
+

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<choice doc:name="Choice">
            <when expression="#[server.dateTime.year-18 &lt; payload.'yearborn']">
                <set-payload value="Sorry #[payload.'firstname'], you're too young to register." doc:name="Too young"/>
            </when>
            <otherwise>
                <set-payload value="Registration has been carried out successfully! Welcome #[payload.'firstname'] #[payload.'lastname']!" doc:name="Success"/>
            </otherwise>
        </choice>

== Post Form by Sending HTTP Requests
To send an HTTP request that contains form parameters, you can use an API client tool such as https://www.postman.com/product/api-client[Postman], or the http://curl.haxx.se/[curl] command line utility.  If you use Postman, make sure you send the form parameters with content-type `x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The following XML example expects to receive a POST request from http://localhost:8081/submitform

[source,xml,linenums]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        </choice>
    </flow>
</mule>

// if you copy/paste the doc in the XML editor, change the left angle bracket to &lt;

The post body contains the following form parameters: `firstname`, `lastname`, `yearborn`:

[source,text,linenums]
----
POST /submitform HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mule/3.6
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 32

firstname=Aaron&lastname=Aguilar+Acevedo&yearborn=1999
----

When the HTTP Listener connector receives the request, it creates a Mule Message that contains a map type payload with the following key-value pairs:

`firstname: Aaron` +
`lastname: Aguilar Acevedo` +
`yearborn: 1999`

Note that in the case of the `lastname` parameter, while the value is encoded on the HTTP request (`Aguilar+Acevedo)`, the connector automatically decodes the value for you when placing it in the Mule Message.

On any of the remaining blocks on the flow, you can easily access the value of the elements in the Map payload by using MEL expressions to refer to their corresponding keys.

In the previous example, the value matching the `yearborn` key is obtained via the expression `#[payload.'yearborn']`. Depending on its value, one of two different paths is followed:
* The first path sets the payload to a message that rejects the registration, referencing the value matching the `firstname` key through a similar MEL expression.
* The second path accepts the registration and welcomes the user by name, referencing the `firstname` and `lastname` values.
