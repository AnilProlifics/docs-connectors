Flow Designer is a tool in Anypoint Design Center that enables you to create apps visually. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To use Flow Designer to configure a connector:

. Configure an input source (trigger) for the connector.
. Configure the connector.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure an Input Source for the Connector

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Start designing*.
. In Design Center, click *Create new*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Enter a project name and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
+
image::introduction/intro-config-fd-go-to-canvas.png[Exit from Let's Get Started]
+
Flow Designer displays an empty trigger card in the middle of the canvas.
. Click on the trigger card.
. Configure one of these input sources for the connector:
* <<http-listener,HTTP Listener>>
* <<scheduler,Scheduler>>
* <<connector-specific,A connector-specific input source>>

[[http-listener]]
=== Use HTTP Listener as an Input Source

`HTTP Listener` listens for HTTP requests on a specified path and initiates the associated flow when it receives a request. To use `HTTP Listener` as an input source:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-input-source,Configure an Input Source for the Connector>>.
. In the *Search* field, enter *HTTP*.
. In the *Operation* field, click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the *Path* field, specify the path on which `HTTP Listener` listens for requests.
. Click *Edit*:
. Click *Add Connection*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter a connection name.
. Select *Listener* as the connection type.
. Enter values for the *Host* and *Port* fields:
* To listen on a specific port for every network interface on the server, leave the default value `0.0.0.0` for *Host*.
* To listen for incoming requests generated inside the server, set the *Port* value to `localhost`.
. Optionally configure a reconnection strategy by expanding *Advanced* and completing the fields in the *Connection* section.
+
The following example configures a reconnection strategy that:
+
* Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and configured reconnection attempts are exhausted
* Limits the number of reconnection attempts to three at a frequency of every 5000 milliseconds (ms)
+
.Use the fields in the Reconnection Strategy section in Flow Designer to specify reconnection options

. To use TLS, specify the required information in the *TLS Configuration* section.
. Click *Save*.

For more information about configuring `HTTP Listener`, see the xref:http/http-documentation.adoc[HTTP Connector Reference].

[[scheduler]]
=== Use Scheduler as an Input Source

Use `Scheduler` to trigger a flow when a time-based condition is met. You can configure `Scheduler` to trigger a flow at a regular interval or give it a more flexible cron expression. For example, you can use `Scheduler` to trigger a flow every five seconds.

To use `Scheduler` as an input source:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-input-source,Configure an Input Source for the Connector>>.
. In the *Trigger* field, select *Scheduler*.
. In the *Scheduling Strategy* field of the *Scheduler configuration* screen, select whether you want to use a fixed frequency or cron expression to trigger the flow:
* If you select *Fixed Frequency*, enter values for these fields:
+
** *Time unit*
+
The time unit for the values of *Frequency* and *Start Delay*.
+
** *Frequency*
+
The frequency at which the Scheduler initiates the flow, based on the time unit specified in the *Time unit* field.
+
** *Start delay*
+
The amount of time to wait before triggering the flow for the first time after the app starts, based on the time unit specified in the *Time unit* field.
+
* If you select *Cron*, enter the cron expression in the *Expression* field and the time zone in the *Time Zone* field. Refer to the `java.util.TimeZone` JavaDoc for the format and valid values for the *Time Zone* field.

For more information about configuring `Scheduler`, see xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler Endpoint (Trigger)]


[[connector-specific]]
=== Use a Connector-Specific Input Source

If a connector has associated input sources, you can use a connector input source to initiate the flow. For example, you can use Amazon SQS Receive Messages as an input source for Amazon SQS Connector. This input source initiates a flow each time the configured Amazon SQS queue receives a new message.

Each connector input source has a unique configuration.

To use a connector-specific input source:

. Follow the procedure described in <<configure-input-source,Configure an Input Source for the Connector>>.
. In the *Trigger* field, search for and select the connector.
. If the connector has multiple input sources, select the input source to use. (If the connector has one input source, that input source is selected automatically.)
. Click *Edit*.
. Select *Add Connection*.
. Specify a connection name.
. In the *Connection* Type field, select an authentication type.
. Complete the required fields.
. Click *Test* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *Save*.
. Select the *Advanced* tab.
. Select a reconnection strategy.

== Configure the Target Component

After you configure an input source for a connector, you can select and configure a connector operation:

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
+
image::introduction/intro-config-fd-plus-sign.png[Click the Plus Sign]
+
. In *Select a component*, search for and select the connector name.
. Select an operation for the connector.
. On the *General* tab, complete the required fields.
. Select the *Advanced* tab.
. Optionally specify a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Edit*.
. Click *Add Connection*.
. Specify a connection name.
. In the *Connection Type* field, select an authentication type.
. Complete the required fields.
. Click *Test* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *Save*.
