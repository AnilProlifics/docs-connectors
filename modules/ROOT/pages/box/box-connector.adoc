Box Connector v4.0

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs and resources on external systems, Box, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday.

Box is an online file sharing and content management service for businesses. The Anypoint Connector for Box is a RAML-based connector that provides synchronization of data and automation of processes between Box
and third party CRMs, CMS, mobile, and social applications. Because this is a RAML-based connector, it uses only REST calls to interact with Box 2.0 API and supports only a subset of services available in the API.
