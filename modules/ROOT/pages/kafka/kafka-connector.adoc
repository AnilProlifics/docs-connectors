== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Kafka, ServiceNow,
and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the Kafka target resource and 
Anypoint Platform. You must also understand how to create a Mule app using 
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

You also need access to Kafka to get values for these fields that appear in Studio and Design Center:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Group id |A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to.
|Bootstrap Servers |Comma-separated host-port pairs used for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This is the same as the `bootstrap.servers` value you provide to Kafka clients (producer and consumer). If this property is provided with producer and consumer properties files, this value is ignored and the one from the properties file is used.
|Principal |(Kerberos and Kerberos SSL) https://www.google.com/search?q=kerberos+principal[Kerberos principal].
|Service name |(Kerberos and Kerberos SSL) The Kerberos principal name that Kafka broker runs as.
|Additional JAAS Properties |(Kerberos and Kerberos SSL) Additional properties as key-value pairs that you need to set in the `sasl.jaas.config` file and that you can include in Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) configuration file.
|Key Store Type |(Kerbero SSL) The file format of the key store file. This is optional for a client.
|Key Store Password |(Kerbero SSL) The store password for the key store file. This is optional for a client and only needed if *Key Store Location* is configured.
|Key Store Location |(Kerbero SSL) The location of the key store file. This is optional for a client and can be used for two-way authentication for a client.
|Trust Store Type |(Kerbero SSL) The file format of the trust store file. The default is `JKS`.
|Trust Store Password |(Kerbero SSL) The password for the trust store file. If a password is not set, access to the truststore is still available, but integrity checking is disabled.
|Trust Store Location |(Kerbero SSL) Location of the trust store.
