Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour]. 

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on field values, see the xref:kafka/kafka-connector-reference.adoc[Kafka Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the name of the trigger card.
. If you are using the Kafka connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; otherwise, search for HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger.

Design Center automatically saves changes you make in a session.

The Kafka connector provides the *Message Consumer* operation as an input source.

To configure the *Message Consumer* operation, set the field values:

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
| Name | Description
| Topic |  Name of the topic to consume messages from.
| Connection |

* <<basiccon>>
* <<sslcon>>
* <<kerbcon>>
* <<kerbssl>>
| Partition Offsets | List of offsets to configure. For each element in the list, specify a partition index and offset. 
| Primary Node Only | Whether this source should execute only on the primary node in a cluster.
|===

To configure a consumer (trigger) for all configurations, set:

* Consumer Partitions +
The number of partitions to use for the consumer.
* Group Id +
A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to.

[[basiccon]]
=== Kafka Basic Consumer Connection

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
| Name | Description
|Bootstrap Servers |Comma-separated host-port pairs used for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This is the same as the `bootstrap.servers` value you provide to Kafka clients (producer and consumer). If this property is provided with producer and consumer properties files, this value is ignored and the one from the properties file is used.
| Additional Properties | Additional properties as key-value pairs that you need for your connection. Here you can put any property Kafka supports.
