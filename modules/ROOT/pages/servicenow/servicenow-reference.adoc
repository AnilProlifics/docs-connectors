When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that can be active at one time. When `maxActive` is exceeded, the pool is referred to as exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can remain idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that can be idle at one time. |  |

Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, which makes `maxActive` meaningless.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT` +
Blocks by invoking `Object.wait(long)` until a new or idle object is available.
* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL` +
Throws a `NoSuchElementException`

If a positive `maxWait` value is supplied, it will block for, at most, that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown. If `maxThreadWait` is a negative value, it will block indefinitely. |  |

* `INITIALISE_ALL` +
Will load all components in the pool on startup |  |
