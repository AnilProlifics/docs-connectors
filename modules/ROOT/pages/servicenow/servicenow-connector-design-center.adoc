Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, 
work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have 
a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. 
For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on Design Center field values, see 
the xref:servicenow/servicenow-connector-reference.adoc[ServiceNow Connector Reference]. 

// Ensure that the connector reference xref and title are correct.

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*. 
. Click the trigger card.
. You can't use ServiceNow connector's operation as an input source trigger. Instead you can use HTTP or Scheduler.
. Click the *Test* button to test the connection.

Design Center automatically saves all changes.

== Configure the Target Component

. Click *+* next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the ServiceNow Connector.
. Select the connector name. 
. Select an operation for the connector.
. Complete these fields:
+
// List the important and required fields and their values in a table.
// Because each operation has different fields, list the fields 
// that are common to each operation and describe them.
