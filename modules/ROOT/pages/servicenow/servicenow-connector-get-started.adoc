ServiceNow Connector Version 6.3.0

The ServiceNow connector provides connections between Mule and ServiceNow apps. Use the ServiceNow operations with the custom ServiceNow tables, along with any operations available through the installed plugins.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect 
to APIs and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the ServiceNow target resource and 
Anypoint Platform. You also need to understand how to create a Mule app using 
Design Center or Anypoint Studio.

// If your connector has other prerequisites, list them here.
