This example creates a Mule flow to get records from the Incident table.

. Create a Mule application as a project in Design Center or Studio 7.
. Add and configure HTTP Listener trigger for your flow with this Path:
+
`getrecords`
+
You can use the default ServiceNow configuration for the Listener connection.
+
. [Optional] To test your ServiceNow environment credentials to the ServiceNow server, configure a new HTTP Request component with BASIC Auth.
. Add a Transform component after the HTTP connector, and provide a transformation script something like this:
+
----
output application/json
---
['description': 'Get Records Demo']
----
+
Notice that the script transforms the output to JSON from the XML input.
+
. Add the Invoke operation from the ServiceNow connector after the Transform component.
* Set up, test, and save a ServiceNow configuration for the connection to the ServiceNow server.
+
If the connection is unsuccessful, you should correct any invalid connection parameters, and test again.
+
* In the General side-tab, set Service to `incident` and Operation to `getRecords`.

+
. Add a Logger to the end of your flow that takes a `payload` (or `#[payload]`) as the message.
. Deploy or Run your app.
. To test the app, navigate to `+http://localhost:8081/incident/getrecords+`
