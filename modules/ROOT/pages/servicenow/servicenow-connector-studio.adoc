. In Exchange, search for "servicenow".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.

== Configure an Input Source

ServiceNow's operations can't be used as an input source, so you'll need to configure it by using an *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Next Step

After configuring the ServiceNow Connector for use in Studio, see the
xref:servicenow/servicenow-connector-examples.adoc[Examples]
to experiment with the connector.
