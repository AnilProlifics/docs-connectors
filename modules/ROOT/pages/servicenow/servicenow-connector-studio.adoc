|===
|Field |Description
|*Username* | Username for log in
|*Password* | Corresponding password
|*Service Address* | The WSDL endpoint
|*ServiceNow Version* | The ServiceNow version being used
|*User table list*| Custom tables for a user that is logged in

== Configure an Input Source

ServiceNow's operations can't be used as an input source, so you'll need to configure it by using an *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Next Step

After configuring the ServiceNow Connector for use in Studio, see the
xref:servicenow/servicenow-connector-examples.adoc[Examples]
to experiment with the connector.
