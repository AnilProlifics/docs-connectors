To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Add the connector to your Studio project.
. Configure the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.

== Add the Connector to a Studio Project

Anypoint Studio provides two ways to add the connector to your Studio project: from the Exchange button in the Studio taskbar or from the Mule Palette view.

=== Add the Connector Using Exchange

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper-left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for "servicenow".
. Select the connector and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Add the Connector in Studio

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type "servicenow" in the search field.
. Click this connector's name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure the Connector

Refer to these values when configuring your connector.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Username* | Username for log in
|*Password* | Corresponding password
|*Service Address* | The WSDL endpoint
|*ServiceNow Version* | The ServiceNow version being used
|*User table list*| Custom tables for a user that is logged in
|===

== Configure an Input Source

ServiceNow's operations can't be used as an input source, so you'll need to configure it by using an *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

== Next Step

After configuring the ServiceNow Connector for use in Studio, see the
xref:servicenow/servicenow-connector-examples.adoc[Examples]
to experiment with the connector.
