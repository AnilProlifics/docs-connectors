== Create a Text File in HDFS

The following example shows how to use the connector to create a text file in HDFS.

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File > New > Mule Project*, name the project, and click *Finish*.
. In the *Mule Palette* search field, type `http`.
. Drag the *HTTP > Listener* operation to the canvas.
. In *General* settings, click the green plus sign (+) to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
. Click *OK* to accept the default settings. 
. In *Path*, enter `/createFile`.
. In the *Mule Palette* search field, type `hdfs`. 
. Drag the HDFS *Write* operation to the canvas.
. Set *Path* to `/test.txt` and leave the default values for the other options. +
This is the path of the file that HDFS will create. 
. Right-click in the project's canvas and select *Run project* to start the application.
. From an HTTP client such as Postman or curl, make a POST request and set the value for `Content-type:plain/text` to `+localhost:8081/createFile+` with the content you want to write as a payload.  +
For example: + 
`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:plain/text" -d "payload to write to file" localhost:8090/createFile`
. Use Hadoop explorer to verify that the `/test.txt` file has been created and has your content.
