==== Parameters
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<config-version-34_basic-authentication-api-v34, Basic Authentication API v34>>
| The connection types to provide to this configuration. | | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.

| Stream Response a| Boolean | Indicates whether received responses should be streamed. If a response is streamed, the connector processes it when receiving is complete. You must read the response once it is received. Otherwise, it will block the read thread. |  `false` |
| Response Buffer Size a| Number | The space in bytes for the buffer where the HTTP response is stored. The `-1` default sets
the buffer size to 10 KB. |  `-1` |
