The Flow Designer feature of Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Flow Designer, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a Design environment. For more information, see the Flow Designer Tour.

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.
