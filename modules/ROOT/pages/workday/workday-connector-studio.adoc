== To Increase Timeout in Studio

Depending on connectivity conditions while using Studio, there can be a timeout while obtaining
metadata from the Workday connector.

=== Symptoms

There can be two types of errors for this condition:

=== Solution

When one of these conditions occurs:

. In Anypoint Studio, navigate to *Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Tooling*.  
. Double the values for `Default Connection Timeout` and `Default Read Timeout`. 
. Click *Apply*, and restart Studio.

== Next Step
