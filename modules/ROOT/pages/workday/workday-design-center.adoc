Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

== Using Trigger

* A trigger is an event that starts a flow in a Mule application.

. Flow Designer appears with an empty trigger card displayed in the middle of the canvas.
