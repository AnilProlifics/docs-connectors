There are several file write modes you can use when writing content to a file:

* OVERWRITE: If the file exists, overwrite it completely.
* APPEND: If the file exists, write the content at the end of it the existing file.
* CREATE_NEW: Create a new file. If the file already exists, then you receive an error.

== Locks

The Write operation supports locking similar to the Read operation. The main difference is that the lock is released automatically after the Write operation finishes.
