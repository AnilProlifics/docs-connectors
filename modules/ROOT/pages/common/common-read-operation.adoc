= MIME Types and Encoding
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

This connector tries to determine a file’s MIME type (`mimeType`) based on its extension. However, when first-hand knowledge of the file’s content is necessary, you can force that `mimeType` to a particular value by using the `outputMimeType` parameter.

The same process works for encoding. By default, the connector assumes that the Mule runtime’s default encoding matches the one in the file. However, you can set the encoding through the `outputEncoding` parameter.

== Why MIME Types Matter

DataWeave expressions are embeddable inside operations that generate payloads and other values. Having the correct `mimeType` set helps DataWeave auto-assign types and, in turn, also generate the correct outputs. It also improves the user experience by maximizing the use of DataSense’s functionality.
