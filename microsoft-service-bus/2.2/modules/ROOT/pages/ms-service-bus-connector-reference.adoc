[[ServiceBusSubscriptionDescription]]
=== Service Bus Subscription Description

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Lock Duration a| String | The default lock duration is applied to subscriptions that do not define a lock duration. You can only set this property at subscription creation time. Valid values: Range:
 0 - 5 minutes. 0 means that the message is not locked. Format: PTx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds (Examples:
 PT5M (5 minutes), PT1M30S (1 minute, 30 seconds)). | PT1M |

 Session-aware subscriptions are not supported through REST. | false |
| Dead Lettering On Message Expiration a| Boolean | This field controls how Service Bus handles a message with an expired TTL. If it is enabled and a message expires, Service Bus moves the message from the queue into the
 subscription's dead-letter sub-queue. If disabled, message is permanently deleted from the subscription's main queue. Settable only at subscription creation time. | false |
| Dead Lettering On Filter Evaluation Exceptions a| Boolean | Determines how Service Bus handles a message that causes an exception during a subscription's filter evaluation. If the value is set to true, the message that caused the
 exception is moved to the subscription's dead-letter queue. Otherwise, it is discarded. By default, this parameter is set to true, enabling you to investigate the cause of
 the exception. It can occur from a malformed message or some incorrect assumptions being made in the filter about the form of the message. Settable only at subscription
 creation time. | false |
| Enable Batched Operations a| Boolean | Enables or disables service-side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus will collect/batch multiple operations to the
 backend to be more connection efficient. If you want lower operation latency, then you can disable this feature. | false |
| Default Message Time To Live a| String | Determines how long a message lives in the subscription. Based on whether dead-lettering is enabled, a message whose Time To Live (TTL) has expired is either moved to the
 subscription's associated DeadLetterQueue, or permanently deleted. If the topic specifies a smaller TTL than the subscription, the topic TTL is applied. Format:
 Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds (Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours) | P10675199DT2H48M5.4775807S |

| Requires Duplicate Detection a| Boolean | If enabled, the topic detects duplicate messages within the time span specified by the DuplicateDetectionHistoryTimeWindow property. Settable only at topic creation time. | false |
| Enable Batched Operations a| Boolean | Enables or disables service side batching behavior when performing operations for the specific queue. When enabled, Service Bus collects/batches multiple operations to the
 back end to be more connection efficient. If you want lower operation latency, you can disable this feature. | true |
| Default Message Time To Live a| String | Determines how long a message lives in the associated subscriptions. Subscriptions inherit the TTL from the topic unless they are created explicitly with a smaller TTL.
 Based on whether dead-lettering is enabled, a message whose TTL has expired will either be moved to the subscription's associated DeadLetterQueue or will be permanently
 deleted. Format: Px1DTx2Hx3Mx4S, where x1 number of days, x2 number of hours, x3 number of minutes, x4 number of seconds (Examples: PT10M (10 minutes), P1DT2H (1 day, 2 hours)). | P10675199DT2H48M5.4775807S |
