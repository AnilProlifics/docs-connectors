* On the send side, the combination of the X12 schema version and this suffix is used as the GS version identifier code. |  |
| Timezone offset| String | Timezone offset from the UTC to apply to the date and time elements in the Interchange Header (ISA) segment. This field accepts only values compliant with ISO 8601, which are UTC-based; for example, `-01:00`, `+0100`, `-0130`, and so on.

If you don't specify a value for this field, the ISA segment date and time is set to the local date and time of the Mule runtime. | |
| Enforce length limits a| Boolean a|  Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for parser or writer values. 

For parser values:

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction with values that are too long or too short. 
* If `false`, the connector uses the values and does not reject the transactions.

In either case the error is logged and reported in 997/999 acknowledgments.

For writer values:

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction that has values that are too long or too short. 
* If `false`, the connector uses the values and does not reject the transaction.|  true |
| Enforce character set a| Boolean a|  Enforce allowed character set flag:

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction that has invalid characters.
* If `false`, the characters are either passed through or substituted and the connector does not reject the transaction.

In either case, the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  true |
| Enforce value repeats a| Boolean a|  Enforce repetition count limits for receive values. 

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction that has values repeated too many or too few times.
* If `false`, the connector accepts the values and does not reject the transaction. 

In either case the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  true |
| Allow unknown segments a| Boolean a|  Allow unknown segments in a transaction set.

* If `false`, the connector rejects a transaction that contains unknown segments.
* If `true`, the connector ignores the unknown segments and does not reject the transaction. 

In either case, the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  false |
| Enforce segment order a| Boolean a|  Enforce the segment order in a transaction set. 

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction that has out of order segments. 
* If `false`, and the connector reorders the segments and does not reject the transaction.

In either case the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  true |
| Allow unused segments a| Boolean a|  Allow segments marked as `Unused` in a transaction set. 

* If `false`, the connector rejects a transaction that contains segments marked as unused in the schema.
* If `true`, the connector ignores the unused segments and does not reject the transaction. 

In either case, the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  false |
| Enforce segment repeats a| Boolean a|  Enforce segment repetition count limits in a transaction set. 

* If `true`, the connector rejects a transaction that repeats the segment too many times.
* If false, the connector ignores the repeated segments and does not reject the transaction. 

In either case the error is reported in 997/999 acknowledgments. |  true |
| Require unique interchanges a| Boolean a|  Require unique Interchange Control Numbers (ISA13) for received interchanges. 

* If `true`, the connector records the previously processed interchange numbers and rejects any duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification). 
* If `false`, the connector continues processing the received interchange and leaves it to the application flow to track interchange numbers and handle them appropriately. |  true |
| Require unique groups a| Boolean a|  Enforce globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups. 

* If `true`, group numbers must be unique across all interchanges received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). 
* If `false`, group numbers must be unique within an interchange. 
|  false |
| Require unique transactions a| Boolean |  Enforce globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets. 

* If `true`, transaction set numbers must be unique across all functional groups received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). 
* If `false`, transaction set control numbers must be unique within a particular functional group. |  false |
| Store time-to-live a| Number |  Minimum number of days to store interchange, group, and transaction set numbers for checking uniqueness. This value is used only when the configuration requires unique interchange, group, or transaction set numbers. The default persistent object store from the Mule configuration is always used for storing the received identifier numbers, and this parameter sets the entry time-to-live for these stored values. |  30 |
| Acknowledge every transaction a| Boolean |  Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set. By default, only transaction sets containing errors are included in the acknowledgment, with transaction sets which aren't included implicitly acknowledged. Changing this flag causes each received transaction set to be explicitly acknowledged. |  false |
| Generate 999 acknowledgments a| Boolean |  Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than 997 Functional Acknowledgments. By default, 997 Functional Acknowledgment transaction sets are generated for each received interchange. Changing this flag causes 999 Implementation Acknowledgments to be generated instead. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation. |  false |
| Report segment details a| Boolean |  Report segment error details to sender in 997/999. If true, the details of any segment errors are included in a generated 997/999. If false, the details are not included. |  true |
| Include Acknowledgment schema a| Boolean |  Expect 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments and include 997/999 schema. By default, the schema for 997/999 acknowledgment transaction sets is automatically included in the set of schemas used by X12 Connector. If false, you need to directly specify the 997 and/or 999 schema if you want these to be processed as input. The schemas used for generating 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments are hardcoded and cannot be modified. |  true |
| Data element separator a| String |  Data element separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  * |
| Component element separator a| String |  Component element separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  > |
| Repetition separator a| String |  Repetition separator character (if used). The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. The value 'U' means repetitions are not used. |  U |
| Segment terminator a| String |  Segment terminator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. |  ~ |
| Segment line ending a| Enumeration, one of:

** NONE
** LF
** CRLF
** CR |  Line ending to add between segments. This allows you to add line endings between segments to improve the readability of the output message text. |  NONE |
| Unique group numbers a| Boolean |  Send globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06). By default, functional group control numbers are assigned sequentially within each interchange and are reused in different interchanges. If true, this instead assigns unique group numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Unique transaction numbers a| Boolean |  Send globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02). 

* If `false`, the connector assigns transaction set control numbers sequentially within each functional group and resuses the control numbers in different groups. 
* If `true`, the connector assigns unique transaction set numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes). |  false |
| Implementation reference a| String |  Implementation convention reference for transactions (ST03). If this value is set, it is used as the ST03 Implementation Convention Reference unless overridden in the message parameters. |  |
| Initial interchange number a| Number |  The initial Interchange Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Initial group number a| Number |  The initial Group Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Initial transaction number a| Number |  The initial Transaction Set Control Number used for outgoing messages. |  1 |
| Request acknowledgments a| Boolean |  Request acknowledgments i.e. TA1 for sent transactions flag (ISA14). If true, TA1 acknowledgments are requested for all sent transactions. |  false |
| Default usage indicator a| String |  Default interchange usage indicator (ISA15): I for Information, P for Production Data, and T for Test Data. |  P |
| Enforce conditional rules a| Boolean | Conditional rules are applied in a transaction. If `true`, a transaction with values not meeting conditional rules is rejected. If `false`, the values are used anyway and the transaction is not rejected. | false |
| Truncate values exceeding the length limits a| Boolean | Works when enforce length values are `true`. If `true`, values exceeding the maximum length are trimmed. If `false`, the values are written as-is. | false |
|Enforce code set validations | Boolean | If `true`, enforces code set validations, as defined in the X12 schemas.| false |
|Use segment line ending in last line | Boolean | If `true`, adds the configured *Segment line ending* value to the end of the IEA segment. | false |
|Report non-fatal errors in acknowledgments | Boolean | If `false`, non-fatal errors are not displayed at segments IK3/AK3 in acknowledgments. | true |
