= X12 EDI Connector 2.5 - Examples - Mule 4

Use this example to translate outbound enterprise purchase order XML messages from back-end ERP into EDI X12 850 transactions. This validates inbound EDI purchase orders received, translate to an Enterprise purchase order with a JSON structure, and integrate with back-end systems.

== Transforming Outbound XML Purchase Order Messages to X12 EDI 850 Transactions

This example shows how to transform Enterprise outbound XML purchase order messages into EDI X12 850 purchase order transactions and then send them to external trading partners such as suppliers as part of an order-to-cash lifecycle.

The flow for this example shows:

* Receiving outbound purchase order transactions from back-end systems via an HTTPS listener.

* Leveraging a DataWeave and X12 Write operation using the X12 EDI Connector to transform XML messages into X12 850 transactions.

These translated EDI purchase order transactions are published to an Anypoint MQ queue and then sent to a supplier via AS2.

== Prerequisites

The example includes the Dataweave map to transform Enterprise outbound XML purchase order messages into EDI X12 4010 850 transactions.

Note: The example uses static configurations for X12 identifiers and Anypoint MQ. They can be replaced with expressions for dynamic routing and setting up of identifiers.
. Open the Example project in Anypoint Studio from Anypoint Exchange.
. Install the latest version of Anypoint X12 connector
. Update the configuration property file located in `src/main/resources/app.properties` with these values:

`tls-truststore.password=test`

`tls-keystore.password=muletest`

=== Configuring Anypoint MQ

. From Anypoint MQ console create a new Anypoint MQ called: `queue b2b-outbound-mythical-as2.q`.

. Create a new client app in Anypoint MQ console.

. Update these properties in the `app.properties` file with the API URL, Client Id and Client Secret for the Anypoint MQ connection:

`anypoint-mq.url`

`anypoint-mq.clientid`

`anypoint-mq.clientsecret`

. Deploy the example to CloudHub or run it locally.

== Running the Example

. Using a REST Client, POST the XML payload `src/main/resources/Enterprise-Outbound-PO.xml` to https://localhost:8443/b2b/enterprise-ob-po/ or https://app-name.cloudhub.io/b2b/enterprise-ob-po/ if deployed to CloudHub.

You see the raw EDI X12 850 purchase order transaction returned as the response. It is also published to the Anypoint MQ queue `b2b-outbound-mythical-as2.q`, ready to be sent to the trading partner.
