= X12 EDI Connector 2.5 - Examples - Mule 4

Use this example to view the use case for Business-to-Business (B2B) EDI integration leveraging Anypoint X12 Connector. This example:

* Transforms XML messages into Outbound EDI X12 850 purchase order transactions +
+
* Transforms Inbound EDI X12 850 purchase orders into JSON +
+
* Generates a Functional acknowledgement (997) +

An HTTPS Listener is used as the message source to receive the Enterprise purchase order XML messages from a back-end system. DataWeave and X12 Writes are used to translate the XML message into an X12 v4010 850 Purchase order EDI message. A (997) Functional Acknowledgment is generated upon receipt of the purchase order message.

== Prerequisites

. Open the Example project in Anypoint Studio from Anypoint Exchange. +
. Install the latest version of Anypoint X12 connector.

=== Run and Test the Example

. Test the Outbound flow by using a REST Client to POST a JSON message to the URL:

`http://localhost:8081/x12/send/enterprise-ob-purchaseorder`

Payload location: `src/main/resources/outbound/Enterprise-Outbound-PO.xml`

The Mule app returns the generated EDI X12 850 transaction.

. Test the Inbound flow using a REST Client to POST a raw EDI X12 850 message message to the URL:

`http://localhost:8081/x12/receive/4010-850`

Payload location: `src/main/resources/inbound/EDI-4010-850-NTO-to-Mythical.edi`
