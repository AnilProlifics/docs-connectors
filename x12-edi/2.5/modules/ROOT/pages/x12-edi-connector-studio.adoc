= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure X12 EDI Connector - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]
Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.
To add and configure a connector in Studio:
. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<conigure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector].
If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:x12-edi-connector-reference.adoc[X12 EDI Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project
In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:
. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.
[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project
Add X12 EDI Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies
to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `X12 EDI: Configuration` in the search field.
. Click X12 EDI in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.
You must change the default Anypoint configuration to use the X12 EDI connector 2.5.

NOTE: Anypoint Studio 7.1.0 or later may require more than the standard memory
configuration to use the X12 EDI connector 2.5.

To change the memory
setting for Studio, edit the Anypoint.ini file in the Anypoint Studio
installation directory and change the two lines starting with `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to:

[source,text,linenums]
----
-Xms4096m
-Xmx4096m
----

This sets the Anypoint Studio memory to 4 GB, which is sufficient
for common usage of this connector.
[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source
A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with X12 EDI Connector:
////
If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source.
////
* <connector-specific input source>
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the text shown below.
////

// Text for using HTTP Listener as an input source
For example, to configure an HTTP listener, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of HTTP *Listener* in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow
When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.
To add an operation for X12 EDI Connector, follow these steps:
. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *X12 EDI* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.
[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector
When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target X12 EDI system. X12 EDI Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.
To configure the global element for X12 EDI Connector, follow these steps:
. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, configure <authentication method 1, authentication method 2, etc.>, as described in the <<authentication method 1 and authentication 2>> > sections.
////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
////
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
////
Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.
[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication
Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:
[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select *Basic*.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.

|===
The following image shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:
.Basic authentication fields
image::<image>.png[To configure authentication, select *Basic* in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]
The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.
Example of wording for Role authentication (this example is for Amazon connectors only)
[[role-authentication]]
=== Role Authentication
Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure Role authentication:
[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Role`.
|Role ARN | Enter the role to assume to gain cross-account access.
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by X12 EDI.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by X12 EDI.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===
The following image shows an example of configuring Role authentication:
.Role authentication fields
image::<image>.png[To configure Role authentication, select *Role* in the *Connection* field and then complete the fields on the *General* tab.]
The first item shows where to specify that the connector will use Role authentication. The second item shows the *General tab*, which contains fields related to Role authentication.
////
[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log
To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:
* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.
Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.
== Next Step
After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:x12-edi-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.


=== About the General Tab

image::x12-edi-general.jpg[General tab properties]

The general tab enables you to configure settings for reading and writing X12 messages:

* X12 form and validation (standard X12, HIPAA SNIP Type 1, or HIPAA SNIP Type 2).
* Manually create or edit the list of schema definitions for the message structures to use. They must all use the same form (either X12 or HIPAA).

**Note:** To use the Functional Acknowledgment schema type (997 or 999) it must match the **Generate 999 Functional Acknowledgments** setting on the Parser tab (`false` for 997, `true` for 999).

* X12 character encoding, used for both send and receive messages.
* X12 character set allowed in string data (BASIC, EXTENDED, or UNRESTRICTED).
* String substitution character, used to replace invalid characters in string data.
* Version identifier code suffix, specifying a value appended to the base schema version in the GS08 Version / Release / Industry Identifier Code field.

=== About the Identity Tab

image::x12-edi-identity.jpg[Identity tab properties]

The Identity tab lets you configure the Interchange Control Header (ISA) and Functional Group Header (GS) identifier values for you and your trading partner in the X12 EDI connector configuration. All these values are optional. If any are configured, the values are verified when reading an input message and used as the defaults when writing an output message if no value is specified in the output data.

The values that can be set are the Interchange ID qualifier and Interchange ID for your Mule application and partner, and the Application Code for Mule and partner. The Mule values specify the Receiver fields (ISA07/ISA08, GS03) in a receive message, and populate the Sender fields (ISA05/ISA06, GS02) fields in a send message.

=== About the Parser Tab

image::x12-edi-parser.jpg[Parser tab properties]

You can set the following options to control parser validation of receive messages if needed:

* Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
* Enforce allowed character set.
* Enforce repetition count limits for receive values.
* Allow unknown segments in a transaction set.
* Enforce segment order in a transaction set.
* Allow segments marked as Unused in a transaction set.
* Enforce segment repetition count limits in a transaction set.
* Enforce conditional rules for receive values.

Note that changing these options from their default setting of true interferes with HIPAA SNIP Type 1 and Type 2 validation of messages. Only use these options with standard X12 data, not with HIPAA.

Other parser options let you:

* Require unique ISA Interchange Control Numbers (ISA13).
* Enforce globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups.
* Enforce globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets.
* Set the minimum number of days to store interchange, group, and transaction set numbers for checking uniqueness.
* Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set (rather than using implicit acknowledgments for transaction sets without errors).
* Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than the 997 Functional Acknowledgments generated by default. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation.
* Report segment error details to sender in the generated 997 or 999 acknowledgments.
* Automatically include a standard 997 or 999 schema that matches the generated acknowledgment in the configuration for received messages.
* Set the path to a Functional Acknowledgment schema to be used for generated acknowledgments such as `/hipaa/005010X231A1/999.esl`, which uses the standard HIPAA 005010X231A1 acknowledgment. +
 The schema type included in the path must match the Generate 999 Functional Acknowledgments setting (`false` for 997, `true` for 999).
 If you do not set the path, the parser uses a hardcoded X12 997 or 999 schema, as appropriate.

=== About the Writer Tab

image::x12-edi-writer.jpg[Writer tab properties]

Writer options let you specify the separator characters used when writing messages, along with:

* Line ending written between segments, used to make the output more readable.
* Whether to generate unique GS group control numbers across interchanges.
* Whether to generate unique ST transaction set control numbers across groups and interchanges.
* An implementation convention reference (ST03) value.
* The starting interchange control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
* The starting group control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
* The starting transaction set control number (used only when no current value is found in the object store).
* The default interchange usage indicator (ISA15), used when no value is present in the message data.
* Whether to request interchange acknowledgments (ISA14).
* Whether to use supplied values for control segment information (control numbers, in particular).
+
The default behavior is to always generate control numbers when writing, this allows you to instead use values you have chosen.
+
* Whether to use the default output MIME type `application/plain`, or the X12-specific alternative `application/edi-x12`.
* Whether to enforce length limits on input data.
* Whether to enforce conditional rules on input data.
+
The default behavior is to ignore conditional rules.
+
* The key-value pair of interchange control key and interchange control number
* The key-value pair of group control key and group control number
* The key-value pair of transaction control key and transaction control number

=== Configuration Options in XML

All values listed in the Studio configuration can be set directly in XML.

General parameters control both send and receive document handling (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|formValidation="X12"/"HIPAA_SNIP1"/"HIPAA_SNIP2" |Schema form and validation level, default is "X12". Schemas used in the configuration must match the form selected, either X12 or  HIPAA.
|schemas=list of values |List of paths for schemas to be used by connector. The paths may be either for a file system or classpath.
|characterEncoding="PLATFORM"/"ASCII"/"ISO8859_1"/"IBM1047"/"UTF8" |Character encoding for messages, default is "PLATFORM", meaning the Mule platform default encoding. This character encoding is always used to both send and receive messages.
|stringCharacterSet="BASIC"/"EXTENDED"/"UNRESTRICTED" |Characters allowed in string data, default is "EXTENDED". Invalid characters are replaced by the substitution character, if used, or rejected as errors if no substitution character is set or enabled for receive messages in parser options.
|stringSubstitutionChar="?" |Substitution character used to replace invalid characters in string values. Default is none.
|versionIdentifierSuffix="XYZ" |Version identifier code suffix for group (GS). If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the GS08 version code must consist of the X12 schema version (004010, 005010, etc.) followed by this suffix. If this value is not set, the receive only verifies that the GS version identifier code starts with the configured schema version. On the send side, the combination of the X12 schema version and this suffix is used as the GS08 value.
|===

Self identification parameters optionally identify your side of the trading partner relationship:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|interchangeIdQualifierSelf="ZZ" |ID qualifier for Mule in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|interchangeIdSelf="mule" |ID for Mule in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID qualifier value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|groupIdSelf="muleapp" |Application Code for Mule in a group (GS segment).
|===

Partner identification parameters optionally identify your partner:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|interchangeIdQualifierSelf="ZZ" |ID qualifier for a partner in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|interchangeIdSelf="partner" |ID for a partner in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID qualifier value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|groupIdSelf="partnerapp" |Application Code for a partner in a group (GS segment).
|===

Parser parameters control the parser operation and the types of error conditions which cause receive transaction sets to be rejected (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|enforceLengthLimits="true" |Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
|enforceCharacterSet="true" |Enforce allowed character set.
|enforceValueRepeats="true" |Enforce repetition count limits for receive values.
|allowUnknownSegments="false" |Allow unknown segments in a transaction sett.
|enforceSegmentOrder="true" |Enforce segment order in a transaction set.
|allowUnusedSegments="false" |Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a transaction set.
|enforceSegmentRepeats="true" |Enforce segment repetition count limits in a transaction set.
|requireUniqueInterchanges="true" |Require unique ISA Interchange Control Numbers (ISA13). The default behavior is to record the interchange numbers previously processed and reject any duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification). If false, this instead allows processing of the received interchange to continue and leaves it to the application flow to track numbers and handle appropriately.
|requireUniqueGroups="false" |"Enforce globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups. By default, group numbers only need to be unique with an interchange. If true, this instead requires group numbers to be unique across all interchanges received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|requireUniqueTransactionSets="false" |Enforce globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets. By default, transaction set control numbers only need to be unique with a particular functional group. If true, this instead requires transaction set numbers to be unique across all functional groups received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|daysToStore="30" |Minimum number of days to store interchange, group, and transaction set numbers for checking uniqueness.
|ackAllSets="false" |Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set. By default, only transaction sets containing errors are included in the acknowledgment, with transaction sets which aren't included implicitly acknowledged. Changing this flag causes each received transaction set to be explicitly acknowledged.
|generate999Acks="false" |Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than 997 Functional Acknowledgments. By default, 997 Functional Acknowledgment transaction sets are generated for each received interchange. Changing this flag causes 999 Implementation Acknowledgments to be generated instead. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation.
|reportSegmentErrors="true" |Report segment error details to sender in 997/999 flag. If true, the details of any segment errors are included in a generated 997/999. If false, the details are not included.
|includeFASchema="true" |Expect 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments and include 997/999 schema. By default, the schema for 997/999 acknowledgment transaction sets is automatically included in the set of schemas used by the X12 EDI Module. If false, you need to directly specify the 997 and/or 999 schema if you want these to be processed as input. The schemas used for generating 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments are hard coded and cannot be modified.
|acknowledgmentSchemaPath="" |Expect the path either from the file system or the classpath. If the path is specified, it overwrites the default acknowledgment path.
|enforceConditionalRules="false" |Enforce conditional rules for receive values.
|===

Writer parameters control the writer operation (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|dataSeparator="*" |Data element separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|componentSeparator=">" |Component separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|repetitionSeparator="U" |Repetition separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. The value U means repetitions are not used.
|segmentTerminator="~" |Segment terminator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|lineEnding="NONE"/"LF"/"CRLF"/"CR" |Line ending to add between segments, which defaults to NONE. This allows you to add line endings between segments to improve the readability of the output message text.
|sendUniqueGroupNumbers="false" |Send unique Group Control Numbers. By default, functional group control numbers are assigned sequentially within each interchange and are reused in different interchanges. If true, this instead assigns unique group numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|sendUniqueTransactionNumbers="false" |Send unique Transaction Set Control Numbers. By default, transaction set control numbers are assigned sequentially within each functional group and are reused in different groups. If true, this instead assigns unique transaction set numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|implementationConventionReference="" |Implementation convention reference for transactions (ST segment). If this value is set, it is used as the ST Implementation Convention Reference unless overridden in the message parameters.
|initialInterchangeNumber="1" |The initial Interchange Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|initialGroupNumber="1" |The initial Group Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|initialSetNumber="1" |The initial Transaction Set Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|ackRequested="false" |Request acknowledgments for sent transactions flag. If true, 997/999 acknowledgments are requested for all sent transactions.
|defaultUsageIndicator="P" |Default ISA15 interchange usage indicator ("I" for Information, "P" for Production Data, "T" for Test Data).
|useSuppliedValues="false" |Use values from supplied data for control segment identifiers (ISA/IEA, GS/GE, ST/SE segments). The default behavior is to always generate control numbers when writing, this allows you to instead use values you have chosen.
|outputEdiMimeType="APPLICATION_PLAIN"/"APPLICATION_EDIX12" |Output MIME type to be set for message, either the default "application/plain" or the X12-specific alternative "application/edi-x12".
|writeEnforceLengthLimits="true" |Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for write values. If true, an exception is thrown when an element is too long or too short. If false, the values are used as is.
|enforceConditionalRules="false" |Enforce conditional rules for write values.
|===


== To Read and Validate X12 EDI Messages

. To read an X12 message, search the palette for X12 EDI and drag the X12 Read operation into a flow.
. Go to the properties view, select the connector configuration you created above and select the Read operation. This operation reads any byte stream into the structure described by your X12 schemas.

The X12 module validates the message when it reads it in. Message validation includes checking the syntax and content of envelope segments ISA, GS, GE, and IEA as well as the actual transaction sets in the message. Normally errors are both logged and accumulated and reported in either TA1 technical acknowledgment segments or 997 acknowledgment transaction sets, and all accepted transaction sets (whether error free or with non-fatal errors) are passed on for processing as part of the output message Map. Errors in reading the input data results in exceptions being thrown.

Error data entered in the receive data map uses the X12Error class, a read-only JavaBean with the following properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|segment |The zero-based index within the input of the segment causing the error.
|segTag |The tag for the segment causing the error.
|fatal |Flag for a fatal error, meaning the associated transaction set, group, or interchange was rejected as a result of the error.
|errorType |Enumeration for the different types of errors defined by the X12 standards: INTERCHANGE_NOTE, GROUP_SYNTAX, TRANSACTION_SYNTAX, SEGMENT_SYNTAX, or ELEMENT_SYNTAX.
|errorCode |Error code, as defined by the X12 standard for the indicated type of error.
|errorText |Text description of the error.
|errorLevel |Enumeration for the different levels of errors: ROOT_LEVEL, INTERCHANGE_LEVEL, GROUP_LEVEL, or TRANSACTION_LEVEL.
|interchangeId |Interchange identifier, if errorLevel INTERCHANGE_LEVEL or above.
|groupId |Group identifier, if errorLevel GROUP_LEVEL or TRANSACTION_LEVEL.
|transactionId |Interchange identifier, if errorLevel TRANSACTION_LEVEL.
|===

Error data is returned by the read operation as optional lists with the "Errors" key at every level of the data structure. At the transaction set level, this list contains non-fatal errors encountered during the parsing of that transaction set. At the interchange level, this list contains errors (both fatal and non-fatal) for transaction sets with fatal errors. At the root level of the read, this list contains both interchange errors and every other error reported at any nested level.

== To Write X12 EDI Messages

To write an outgoing message, search the palette for X12 EDI and drag the X12 Write operation into a flow. Construct an outgoing X12 EDI message according to the structure as defined above for input to the write operation. If no errors are found in the write operation the normal flow continues. Otherwise, an exception is thrown which includes an array of X12Error instances, the same as returned by the Read operation (documented above).

== To Send Functional Acknowledgments

Sending generated functional acknowledgments (997 or 999 transaction sets) is the same as writing any other EDI message, except you set the transactions to the acknowledgments that were generated during the read operation.

For example:

image::x12-edi-ack-flow.jpg[Ack Flow Diagram]

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<x12-edi:read config-ref="X12_EDI__Configuration" doc:name="Read EDI Doc"/>
  ...
<dw:transform-message doc:name="Create Outgoing Acks Message">
    <dw:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	TransactionSets: {
		v005010: {
			'997' : payload.FunctionalAcksGenerated
		}
	}
}]]></dw:set-payload>
</dw:transform-message>
<x12-edi:write config-ref="X12_EDI__Configuration" doc:name="Send Acks"/>
----

The generated functional acknowledgments have interchange data set up for sending back to the sender of the original message, so you don't need to change anything in the transactions to do the send.

If you use 999 acknowledgments, add any required CTX segments yourself to the basic structure generated by the X12 Module. The X12 connector does not track implementation convention changes to the base transaction set structure.

== Sending Interchange Acknowledgments

To send interchange acknowledgments (TA1 segments), set the value of the InterchangeAcksToSend key in the message map to the list of TA1 segment maps to be sent.
