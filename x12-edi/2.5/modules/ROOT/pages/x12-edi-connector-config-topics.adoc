= X12 EDI - Additional Configuration Information - Mule 4

// Add brief introduction

=== Configuration Options in XML

All values listed in the Studio configuration can be set directly in XML.

General parameters control both send and receive document handling (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|formValidation="X12"/"HIPAA_SNIP1"/"HIPAA_SNIP2" |Schema form and validation level, default is "X12". Schemas used in the configuration must match the form selected, either X12 or  HIPAA.
|schemas=list of values |List of paths for schemas to be used by connector. The paths may be either for a file system or classpath.
|characterEncoding="PLATFORM"/"ASCII"/"ISO8859_1"/"IBM1047"/"UTF8" |Character encoding for messages, default is "PLATFORM", meaning the Mule platform default encoding. This character encoding is always used to both send and receive messages.
|stringCharacterSet="BASIC"/"EXTENDED"/"UNRESTRICTED" |Characters allowed in string data, default is "EXTENDED". Invalid characters are replaced by the substitution character, if used, or rejected as errors if no substitution character is set or enabled for receive messages in parser options.
|stringSubstitutionChar="?" |Substitution character used to replace invalid characters in string values. Default is none.
|versionIdentifierSuffix="XYZ" |Version identifier code suffix for group (GS). If this value is set, it affects both send and receive message handling. On the receive side, the GS08 version code must consist of the X12 schema version (004010, 005010, etc.) followed by this suffix. If this value is not set, the receive only verifies that the GS version identifier code starts with the configured schema version. On the send side, the combination of the X12 schema version and this suffix is used as the GS08 value.
|===

Self identification parameters optionally identify your side of the trading partner relationship:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|interchangeIdQualifierSelf="ZZ" |ID qualifier for Mule in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|interchangeIdSelf="mule" |ID for Mule in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID qualifier value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|groupIdSelf="muleapp" |Application Code for Mule in a group (GS segment).
|===

Partner identification parameters optionally identify your partner:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|interchangeIdQualifierSelf="ZZ" |ID qualifier for a partner in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|interchangeIdSelf="partner" |ID for a partner in Exchange (ISA segment). This value is used in combination with the Interchange ID qualifier value, and if one is set the other must also be set.
|groupIdSelf="partnerapp" |Application Code for a partner in a group (GS segment).
|===

Parser parameters control the parser operation and the types of error conditions which cause receive transaction sets to be rejected (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|enforceLengthLimits="true" |Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
|enforceCharacterSet="true" |Enforce allowed character set.
|enforceValueRepeats="true" |Enforce repetition count limits for receive values.
|allowUnknownSegments="false" |Allow unknown segments in a transaction sett.
|enforceSegmentOrder="true" |Enforce segment order in a transaction set.
|allowUnusedSegments="false" |Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a transaction set.
|enforceSegmentRepeats="true" |Enforce segment repetition count limits in a transaction set.
|requireUniqueInterchanges="true" |Require unique ISA Interchange Control Numbers (ISA13). The default behavior is to record the interchange numbers previously processed and reject any duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification). If false, this instead allows processing of the received interchange to continue and leaves it to the application flow to track numbers and handle appropriately.
|requireUniqueGroups="false" |"Enforce globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups. By default, group numbers only need to be unique with an interchange. If true, this instead requires group numbers to be unique across all interchanges received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|requireUniqueTransactionSets="false" |Enforce globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets. By default, transaction set control numbers only need to be unique with a particular functional group. If true, this instead requires transaction set numbers to be unique across all functional groups received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|daysToStore="30" |Minimum number of days to store interchange, group, and transaction set numbers for checking uniqueness.
|ackAllSets="false" |Include a separate AK2/AK5 (997) or AK2/IK5 (999) acknowledgment for every received transaction set. By default, only transaction sets containing errors are included in the acknowledgment, with transaction sets which aren't included implicitly acknowledged. Changing this flag causes each received transaction set to be explicitly acknowledged.
|generate999Acks="false" |Generate 999 Implementation Acknowledgments, rather than 997 Functional Acknowledgments. By default, 997 Functional Acknowledgment transaction sets are generated for each received interchange. Changing this flag causes 999 Implementation Acknowledgments to be generated instead. Note that the support for 999 Implementation Acknowledgments does not include CTX segment generation.
|reportSegmentErrors="true" |Report segment error details to sender in 997/999 flag. If true, the details of any segment errors are included in a generated 997/999. If false, the details are not included.
|includeFASchema="true" |Expect 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments and include 997/999 schema. By default, the schema for 997/999 acknowledgment transaction sets is automatically included in the set of schemas used by the X12 EDI Module. If false, you need to directly specify the 997 and/or 999 schema if you want these to be processed as input. The schemas used for generating 997 or 999 Functional Acknowledgments are hard coded and cannot be modified.
|acknowledgmentSchemaPath="" |Expect the path either from the file system or the classpath. If the path is specified, it overwrites the default acknowledgment path.
|enforceConditionalRules="false" |Enforce conditional rules for receive values.
|===

Writer parameters control the writer operation (all are optional, with default values as shown):

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|XML Value |Visual Studio Option
|dataSeparator="*" |Data element separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|componentSeparator=">" |Component separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|repetitionSeparator="U" |Repetition separator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level. The value U means repetitions are not used.
|segmentTerminator="~" |Segment terminator character. The configured value is used by default for all output messages, but can be overridden at the message level.
|lineEnding="NONE"/"LF"/"CRLF"/"CR" |Line ending to add between segments, which defaults to NONE. This allows you to add line endings between segments to improve the readability of the output message text.
|sendUniqueGroupNumbers="false" |Send unique Group Control Numbers. By default, functional group control numbers are assigned sequentially within each interchange and are reused in different interchanges. If true, this instead assigns unique group numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|sendUniqueTransactionNumbers="false" |Send unique Transaction Set Control Numbers. By default, transaction set control numbers are assigned sequentially within each functional group and are reused in different groups. If true, this instead assigns unique transaction set numbers across all interchanges sent to the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).
|implementationConventionReference="" |Implementation convention reference for transactions (ST segment). If this value is set, it is used as the ST Implementation Convention Reference unless overridden in the message parameters.
|initialInterchangeNumber="1" |The initial Interchange Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|initialGroupNumber="1" |The initial Group Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|initialSetNumber="1" |The initial Transaction Set Control Number used for outgoing messages.
|ackRequested="false" |Request acknowledgments for sent transactions flag. If true, 997/999 acknowledgments are requested for all sent transactions.
|defaultUsageIndicator="P" |Default ISA15 interchange usage indicator ("I" for Information, "P" for Production Data, "T" for Test Data).
|useSuppliedValues="false" |Use values from supplied data for control segment identifiers (ISA/IEA, GS/GE, ST/SE segments). The default behavior is to always generate control numbers when writing, this allows you to instead use values you have chosen.
|outputEdiMimeType="APPLICATION_PLAIN"/"APPLICATION_EDIX12" |Output MIME type to be set for message, either the default "application/plain" or the X12-specific alternative "application/edi-x12".
|writeEnforceLengthLimits="true" |Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for write values. If true, an exception is thrown when an element is too long or too short. If false, the values are used as is.
|enforceConditionalRules="false" |Enforce conditional rules for write values.
