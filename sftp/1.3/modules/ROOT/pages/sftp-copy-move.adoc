= Copy and Move Files with the SFTP Connector - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::sftp/sftp-copy-move.adoc

Anypoint Connector for SFTP (SFTP Connector) Copy and Move operations provides the ability to copy and move files or directories on demand.

While SFTP has a native concept of copying and moving, FTP does not. FTP Connector simulates these operations by downloading file content and writing it to a new location. Although all of this is done with concurrent streams that start writing at the same time as it starts reading, copying and moving does have a significant network overhead and should be used wisely. SFTP Connector Move operation does not impact network overhead.

== Configure the Copy Operation in Studio

To add and configure the Copy operation in Studio, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search `sftp` and select the *Copy* operation.
. Drag the *Copy* operation onto the Studio canvas.
. In the *General* tab of the operation configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. Specify the connection information and click *OK*.
. Set the *Source path* field to the path of the file to copy, for example `source.txt`.
. Set the *Target path* field to the directory path into which the file is to be copied, for example `backup`.
. Set the *Rename to* field to rename the file as part of the operation, for example `renamed.txt`. +
This parameter must be a file name, not a path. If this attribute is not provided, the original file name is used.

The following screenshot shows the *Copy* operation configuration:

  targetPath="backup" overwrite="true|false"
  createParentDirectories="true|false"
  renameTo="renamed.txt"/>
