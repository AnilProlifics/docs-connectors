= Configure an ActiveMQ Connection
:keywords: jms, connector, jms_1.0.2b, jms_1.1, jms_2.0, activemq
:page-aliases: connectors::jms/jms-activemq-configuration.adoc

Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) includes an ActiveMQ connection configuration, which provides support for ActiveMQ 5. Using this connection, you can set JMS 1.1 (default), JMS 1.0.2b, or JMS 2.0 specifications, and you can configure not only all of the general connection parameters for JMS but also the custom parameters that are present only in ActiveMQ.

== Configure an ActiveMQ Connection

After you declare the ActiveMQ connection, customize *Connection Factory* to your desired configuration. Every parameter in the connection comes with a default value, meaning that you are required to configure only the parameters relevant for your use case. Also, the ActiveMQ connection exposes parameters that are exclusive to the ActiveMQ implementation, like *Initial redelivery delay*.

In the following example, you configure an *ActiveMQ Connection*:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create*.
. In the filter box type `jms` and select *JMS Config*.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Connection* field select *ActiveMQ Connection*.
. In the *Factory configuration* field, select *Edit Inline*.
. Set the *Broker url* field value to the address of the broker to connect to, for example, `tcp://localhost:61616`.
. Click *OK*.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:active-mq-connection>` and `<jms:factory-configuration>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection >
   <jms:factory-configuration brokerUrl="tcp://localhost:61616" />
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
 </jms:config>
----

== Configure the Required Libraries

When you configure any connection type, you must always configure a library containing the JMS client implementation, because JMS Connector is not bound to any particular implementation. Configure ActiveMQ external libraries in the global elements view of Studio or manually add the library dependency in your `pom.xml` file.

* *ActiveMQ KahaDB* +
The `activemq-kahadb-store` dependency is required only when using an persistent in-memory broker based on the VM transport (such as `+vm://localhost?broker.persistent=true+`). This dependency provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.KahaDBPersistenceAdapter` implementation. This dependency is also required for persistent message delivery.
+
In your `pom.xml` file in Studio, adding the dependency looks like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-kahadb-store</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.4</version>
</dependency>
----

* *ActiveMQ Broker* +
The `activemq-broker` dependency is required only when using an in-memory broker based on the VM transport (which is the one configured by default). This dependency provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.broker.Broker` implementation.
+
In your `pom.xml` file in Studio, adding the dependency looks like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-broker</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.4</version>
</dependency>
----

* *ActiveMQ Client* +
The `activemq-client` dependency is always required to use ActiveMQ connections. Choose one that provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory` implementation.

In your `pom.xml` file in Studio, adding the dependency looks like this:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
     <artifactId>activemq-client</artifactId>
     <version>5.14.4</version>
 </dependency>
----

To configure these libraries in the Global Element view, follow these steps:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create*.
. In the filter box, type `jms` and select *JMS Config*.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Connection* field, select *ActiveMQ Connection*.
. In the *Required Libraries* section that shows the *ActiveMQ KahaDB*, *ActiveMQ Broker* and *ActiveMQ Client* libraries, click the *Configure...* button to install the dependency.
. Select any of the following install options:

* *Add recommended library* Installs the recommended library.
* *Use local file* Browse to a local file for the required engine library and install it.
* *Add Maven dependency* Browse to the dependency and install it.

== Configure the In-Memory Broker

By default, Anypoint Connector for ActiveMQ (ActiveMQ Connector) uses an in-memory broker, which makes it
easy to start building an application without configuring a connection against an external broker.
The in-memory broker is required to configure both the *ActiveMQ KahaDB* and *ActiveMQ Broker* libraries. The default URL is:

`vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&broker.useJmx=false`

To configure the in-memory broker in Studio, follow these steps:

. In Studio, open the *JMS Config* global element window.
. In the *Connection Factory* section, set the *Factory configuration* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Broker url* field to the address of the broker to connect, for example, `vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&broker.useJmx=false` .
. Click *OK*.

.JMS Connector In-Memory Broker Configuration

In the XML editor, the `brokerUrl` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config" doc:name="JMS Config">
		<jms:active-mq-connection >
			<jms:factory-configuration brokerUrl="vm://localhost?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false"/>
		</jms:active-mq-connection>
	</jms:config>
----

== Configure the Message Redelivery

When a message cannot be processed correctly, it's not acknowledged. The message is then redelivered and probably again not processed correctly, which causes the cycle to execute indefinitely.

To prevent a message that can't be properly managed from endlessly redelivering, configure the *Max redelivery* field to set a maximum number of times that a message can be delivered to the application.  +
By default, JMS Connector uses a maximum redelivery of `0`, which means that messages won't be redelivered, and doesn't matter if the message is recovered or rolled back from a transaction. If the message has persistent delivery set, ActiveMQ sends the message to a `DLQ.QUEUE` (dead letter queue).

ActiveMQ enables you also to have a client-side redelivery configuration:

* The *Initial redelivery delay* field enables you to configure in milliseconds how much time to wait for the message to be redelivered the first time. +
* The *Redelivery delay* field enables you to configure in milliseconds how much time to wait until the message is subsequently redelivered after the first redelivery.

To configure these fields in Studio, follow these steps:

. In Studio, open the *JMS Config* global element window.
. In the *Connection Factory* section, set the *Factory configuration* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Initial redelivery delay* field to `1000`.
. Set the *Redelivery delay* field to `100`.
. Set the *Max redelivery* field to `10`.
. Click *OK*.

In the XML editor, the `maxRedelivery`,`redeliveryDelay` and `initialRedeliveryDelay` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration maxRedelivery="10"
      redeliveryDelay="100"
      initialRedeliveryDelay="1000"/>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

== Configure the Trusted Packages

ActiveMQ versions 5.12.2, 5.13.0, and later restricts the classes that can be serialized and deserialized to prevent the execution of a malicious payload that can exploit the host system.

For ActiveMQ, JMS Connector enables only the JDK and JRE provided classes by default, so if you
need to exchange object messages, you must add the packages your applications use by activating the *Trusted packages* field. +
Even though you can also enable the *Trust all packages* field to allow the serialization of more classes by allowing any object to be serialized and deserialized, this is not as secure as leaving it disabled in most cases. Keep this parameter disabled to improve the security and help prevent malicious attacks.

In the following example, you configure the connection to enable only users who are compliant with the `com.mulesoft.someapp` and `com.mulesoft.someapp.model` packages to consume and produce ObjectMessages:

. In Studio, open the *JMS Config* global element window.
. In the *Connection Factory* section, set the *Factory configuration* field to *Edit inline*.
. Select the *Trusted packages* field.
. Click the plus sign to add a new package.
. In the *Trusted package* window, set the *Value* field to `com.mulesoft.someapp`.
. Click *Finish*.
. Repeat Step 4.
. In the *Trusted package* window, set the *Value* field to `com.mulesoft.someapp.model`.
. Click *Finish*.
. Select the *Trust all packages* field.
. Click *OK*.

.JMS Connector Trusted Packages configuration
image::jms-activemq-packages.png[Select the Trusted packages and Trust all packages field]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:trusted-packages>` and `trustAllPackages` configurations look like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
    <jms:factory-configuration trustAllPackages="true">
      <jms:trusted-packages >
        <jms:trusted-package value="com.mulesoft.someapp" />
        <jms:trusted-package value="com.mulesoft.someapp.model" />
      </jms:trusted-packages>
    </jms:factory-configuration>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

== Configure SSL Connections

JMS Connector version 1.3.0 and later enables you to configure ActiveMQ connections with SSL configurations to establish secure and encrypted connections against the ActiveMQ broker:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create*.
. In the filter box type `jms` and select *JMS Config*.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Connection* field select *ActiveMQ Connection*.
. Navigate to the *TLS/SSL* tab.
. In the *TLS Configuration* field, select *Edit Inline*
. In the *Trust Store Configuration* section, set the following fields:
+
* *Path*: `client.ts` +
* *Password*: `password` +
[start=9]
. In the *Key Store Configuration* section, set the following fields:
+
* *Path*: `client.ks` +
* *Alias*: `client` +
* *Key Password*: `password` +
* *Password*: `password` +
[start-10]
. Click *OK*.

.JMS Connector SSK Configuration
image::jms-activemq-ssl.png[SSL Configuration.]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:active-mq-connection>`, `<tls:trust-store>`, and `<tls:key-store>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection>
   <tls:context>
    <tls:trust-store
      path="client.ts"
      password="password" />
    <tls:key-store
      path="client.ks"
      password="password"
      keyPassword="password"
      alias="client" />
   </tls:context>
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
</jms:config>
----

JMS Connector can also reference global TLS context configurations to reuse and share the same TLS context between connectors as shown in the following example with Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector):

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<!--  HTTP Requester Configuration -->
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_configuration">
  <http:request-connection tlsContext="TLS_Context" />
</http:request-config>

<!--  JMS Configuration -->
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection tlsContext="TLS_Context"/>
</jms:config>

<!--  Reusable TLS Context -->
<tls:context name="TLS_Context">
 <tls:trust-store
  path="client.ts"
  password="password" />
<tls:key-store
  path="client.ks"
  password="password"
  keyPassword="password"
  alias="client" />
</tls:context>
----
