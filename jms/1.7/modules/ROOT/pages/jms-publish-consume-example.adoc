= Publish and Consume Messages within Flows Example - Mule 4

The following example illustrates how to configure Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) *Publish consume* operation to publish and consume messages within two flows, and uses a correlation id to ensure that the incoming messages are the proper reply of the outgoing message.

* In the first flow, an *HTTP Listener* source initiates the flow by reading random content posted via HTTP.
* Then, the *Publish consume* operation publishes a message to a destination queue (`Q1`) with the content payload received from the HTTP Listener source.
* Subsequently, in the second flow, an *On New Message* operation listens for the message sent to the queue `Q1` set in the first flow.
* Then, in the second flow a *Publish* operation publishes the message into a new destination queue (`Q2`) with a correlation id attribute, so the request and reply messages are correlated within the two flows.
* Again in the first flow, the *Publish consume* operation consumes the message sent to the queue `Q2` that matches the correlation id.
* Finally, a *Set Payload* component returns the value `It Works!`.

To test this example, you must:

. Have a Docker instance of ActiveMQ broker.
. Create two queues `Q1` and `Q2` with the ActiveMQ broker.
. Create the Mule application.
. Run and test the application with curl commands.

To install a Docker instance of ActiveMQ broker and how to create the queues, follow their respective documentation guidelines.

== Create the First Flow

To start creating your Mule application, create the first flow:

. In Studio, in the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag the HTTP *Listener* source to the Studio canvas.
. On the *HTTP Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Set the *Path* field to `/test`
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of HTTP Listener in the app.
. On the *General* tab, set the following parameters:
+
* *Host*: `All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (default)`
* *Port*: `8081`
+
. Click *OK*.
. Drag the *Publish consume* operation to the right of HTTP Listener.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of Publish consume in the app.
. Set the *Connection* field to *ActiveMQ Connection*.
. In the *Required Libraries* section, click *Configure...* to install the dependencies.
. Set the *Specification*, *Caching strategy* fields to their default values.
. Set both the *Username* field and *Password* field to `admin`.
. Set the *Factory configuration* to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Broker url* field to `tcp://localhost:61616`.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Publish consume > General* section, set the *Destination* field to `Q1` to create the queue to publish the message with the payload content of the HTTP Listener.
. In the *Message* section, set the *Correlation ID* to `0303456`.
. Set the *Reply To* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Destination Name* field to `Q2`. +
This is the destination queue that will be used to consume the message sent by the Publish operation in the second flow.
. In the *Consume Configuration* section, set the *Ack mode* field to *IMMEDIATE*.

[start=22]
. Drag a *Set Payload* component to the right of Publish consume.
. Set the *Value* field to `It Works!`.

== Create the Second Flow

Continue creating the application by adding the second flow:

. Drag a JMS *On New Message* source below the first flow.
. Repeat steps 9 through 16 from the previous section to create a global element for the source.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, set the *Destination* field to `Q1`. +
This indicates that the source is listening to the destination set in the Publish consume operation of the first flow.
. Drag the JMS *Publish* operation to the right of the source.
. Set the *Connector configuration* to the same configuration you set for the *On New Message* source.
. Set the *Destination* field to `Q2`. +
This indicates that the message is published to the destination queue of the Publish consume operation of the first flow.
. In the *Message* section, set the *Correlation ID* field to `attributes.headers.correlationId`, so the request and reply messages are correlated.

== Run and Test your Mule Application

After creating your Mule application, run and test it:

. In Studio, save your Mule app.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Open a browser and type `+http://0.0.0.0:8081/test+`. +

== XML for Publishing and Consuming within Flows

Paste this code into your Studio XML editor to quickly load the flow for this example into your Mule app:
