Anypoint Connector for JMS (Java Message Service) (JMS Connector) enables sending and receiving messages to queues and topics for any message service that implements the JMS specification. JMS is a widely-used API for message oriented middleware. It enables the communication between different components of a distributed application to be loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous. The JMS Connector main features include:

* Publish and subscribe pattern support on any given destination.
* Listen and reply pattern support on any given destination.
* Publish-Consume pattern support on any given destination, with a fixed or temporary reply queue.
* Fully compliant with JMS 2.0, 1.1, and 1.0.2 specifications.

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you must be familiar with:

* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)
* Elements and global elements in a Mule flow
* Creating a Mule app using Anypoint Studio (Studio)

Before creating an app, you must have access to Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio.

== Common Use Cases for the Connector

JMS Connector enables you to:

* Listen for new messages as they arrive to the destination.
* Publish a new message and send it to the specified destination.
* Consume a message at any given time in the flow from any given destination.
* Publish a message to any destination, and then wait for a reply on a different destination.

For examples, see xref:jms-examples.adoc[JMS Connector Examples].

== JMS Messaging Support Models

JMS supports two models for messaging:

* Point-to-point queues
* Publish and subscribe topics

=== Point-to-Point Queues

In the point-to-point or queuing model, a sender posts messages to a particular queue and a receiver reads messages from the queue. In this model, the sender knows the destination of the message and posts the message directly to the receiverâ€™s queue.

The point-to-point queuing model is as follows:

* Only one consumer receives the message.
* The sender does not need to be running at the time the consumer consumes the message, nor does the consumer need to be running at the time the message is sent.
* Every message that is successfully processed is acknowledged by the consumer.

=== Publish and Subscribe Topics

The publish-subscribe model supports publishing messages to a particular message topic. Subscribers can register to receive messages on a particular message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber are aware of each other. An anonymous bulletin board is a good analogy for this concept.

The publish-subscribe model is as follows:

* Multiple consumers (or none) receive the message.
* The publisher must create a message topic to which clients can subscribe.
* The subscriber must remain continuously active to receive messages, unless it has established a durable subscription, in which case, messages published while the subscriber is not connected are redistributed when the subscriber reconnects.

== Next Step

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create your own app and configure the connector using xref:database-connector-studio.adoc[Anypoint Studio].
