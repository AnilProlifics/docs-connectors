= Configure Message Acknowledgement with the JMS Connector
:keywords: jms, connector, consume, message, ack
:page-aliases: connectors::jms/jms-ack.adoc

Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) provides different message acknowledgement modes to configure for the *Ack*, *Consume*, *On New Message* and *Recovery session* operations:

* Automatic acknowledgement on success
* Immediate acknowledgement
* Manual acknowledgement

The following examples illustrate how to configure the modes for the operations.

== Configure Automatic Acknowledgement On Success Mode

Configure the automatic acknowledgement on success mode in the *On New Message* source by setting the *Acknowledge Mode* field to either one of these modes:

* *AUTO* +
Automatically acknowledges (AKC) the received message only if the flow execution completes successfully. In case of an error, the message is not acknowledged and the redelivery occurs.

* *DUPS_OK* +
Automatically acknowledges (AKC) the received message only if the flow execution completes successfully but may lead to duplicates because the message may be redelivered before the ACK is performed.

In the following example, you configure the *AUTO* acknowledgement mode:

. In Studio, select the *On New Message* source from your flow.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `#[vars.destination]`.
. Set the *Acknowledge Mode* field to *AUTO*.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:listener>` and `ackMode` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:listener  config-ref="JMS_Config" destination="#[vars.destination]" ackMode="AUTO"/>
----

== Configure Immediate Acknowledgement Mode

Configure the immediate acknowledgement mode in the *On New Message* source by using the *Acknowledge Mode* field, or in the *Consume* operation by using the *Ack mode* field. Set these fields to *IMMEDIATE*. This mode automatically acknowledges (AKC) the message once it is consumed and prior to any application processing of the message. +
Automatically acknowledging the message once it is received indicates that the message won't be redelivered if any error occurs during the processing of the message, so an application logic like a dead letter queue has to be created to manage errors without losing messages.

In the following example, you configure the *IMMEDIATE* acknowledgement mode for the *Consume* operation:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `#[vars.destination]`.
. Set the *Ack mode* field to *IMMEDIATE*.

== Configure Manual Acknowledgement Mode

Configure the manual acknowledgement mode in the *On New Message* source by using the *Acknowledge Mode* field, or in the *Consume* operation by using the *Ack mode* field, and set these fields to *MANUAL*. This mode delegates all the responsibility of performing the acknowledgement (ACK) on the message to the application logic.

Every message received by either the *On New Message* or *Consume* operations have an acknowledgement ID available in the Mule message attributes which identifies the message uniquely for a given connection. +
The acknowledgement ID that identifies the message is then passed to the *Ack* operation in the *Ack id* field.

In the following example, you configure the *MANUAL* acknowledgement mode for the *Consume* operation:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `openTickets`.
. Set the *Ack mode* field to *MANUAL*.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the *Consume* operation.
. Set the *Message* field to `#[payload]`.
. Drag an *Ack* operation to the right of the *Logger* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to the acknowledgement ID of the message session to recover, for example, `#[attributes.ackId]`.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:consume>`, `ackMode`, and `ackId` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <jms:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="openTickets" ackMode="MANUAL"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <jms:ack ackId="#[attributes.ackId]"/>
</flow>
----


=== Configure Manual Session Recovery

When using the manual acknowledgement mode, all received messages and not acknowledged are not redelivered by the broker.
In case of an error during the message processing, you can manually recover all the messages in the session that have to be redelivered using the *Recover session* operation. The connection used to recover the session has to be the the same as the connection for receiving the message.

In the following example, you configure the *MANUAL* acknowledgement mode and how to recover the session:

. In Studio, select the *Consume* operation from your flow.
. In the *Consume* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from which to consume the message, for example, `${destination}`.
. Set the *Ack mode* field to *MANUAL*.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of the *Consume* operation.
. Set the *Message* field to `#[payload]`.
. Drag an *Ack* operation to the right of the *Logger* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to the acknowledgement ID of the message session to recover, for example, `#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]`.
. In your flow, expand the *Error handling* section by clicking the small arrow.
. Drag an *On Error Propagate* component in the *Error handling* section.
. Drag a *Recover session* operation inside the *On Error Propagate* component.
. Set the *Ack id* field to `#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]`.

In the XML editor, the `<jms:consume>`, `ackMode`, and `ackId` configurations looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="consumerWithManualAck">
    <jms:consume config-ref="JMS_config" destination="${destination}"
                 ackMode="MANUAL" target="consumedMessage" targetValue="#[message]"/>

    <!--Do message processing-->
    <logger message="#[payload]">

    <jms:ack ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>

    <error-handler>
        <on-error-propagate>
            <!--In case of error, recover the session-->
            <jms:recover-session ackId="#[vars.consumedMessage.attributes.ackId]"/>
        </on-error-continue>
    </error-handler>
</flow>
