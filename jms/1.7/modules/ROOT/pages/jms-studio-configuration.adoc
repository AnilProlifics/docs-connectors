= Use Studio to Configure JMS Connector 1.7 - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-connection,Configure the connection to a broker>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:jms-connector-reference.adoc[JMS Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `jms` in the search field.
. Click *JMS Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Database Connector:

* *JMS > On New Message* +
Initiates a flow by listening for incoming messages
* *HTTP > Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an *On New Message* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *JMS > On New Message*.
. Drag *On New Message* to the Studio canvas.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the source in the app.
. In the *JMS Config* window, for *Connection* select any of the connection types to provide to this configuration:

* *Active MQ Connection*
* *Generic Connection*

[start=6]
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector, such as required libraries for the broker, JMS specification, cache strategy, authentication, connection factory.
. On the *TLS/SSL* tab, optionally specify TLS configuration.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection strategy, and XA connection pool.
. Click *OK* to close the window.
. In the *On New Message* configuration screen, in *Destination*, specify the name of the destination from where to consume the message.
. Configure other optional fields on the *On New Message* configuration screen.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for JMS Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *JMS Connector* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the input source.

The following screenshot shows the JMS Connector operations in the Mule Palette view of Anypoint Studio:

.JMS Connector Operations

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, itâ€™s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. JMS Connector comes with a fine tuned set of default values, both for publishing and consuming messages. The only requirement is to configure which connection to use. You can define a global default behavior for all the operations associated to the configuration and then override each parameter only in the operations that require a custom behavior.

To configure the global element for JMS Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *JMS Config* window, for *Connection* select any of the connection types to provide to this configuration:

* *Active MQ Connection*
* *Generic Connection*

[start=4]
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector, such as required libraries for the broker, JMS specification, cache strategy, authentication, connection factory.
. On the *TLS/SSL* tab, optionally specify TLS configuration.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection strategy, and XA connection pool.
. On the *Consumer* tab, optionally define global default behavior configurations for all the *Consume* and *On New Message* operations you have in your flow.
. On the *Producer* tab, optionally define global default behavior configurations for all the *Publish* and *Publish consume* operations you have in your flow.
. Click *OK* to close the window.

The following screenshot shows the JMS Connector *Global Element Configuration* window in Anypoint Studio:

.JMS Connector Global Element Configuration
image::jms-global-configuration.png[JMS Connector Global Element Configuration window]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:config>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection clientId="${env.clientId}"/>
</jms:config>
----

In the following example, you define a default *Selector* behavior when consuming a message in any of the *Consume* or *On New Message* operations associated to this configuration, while every *Publish* or *Publish consume* operations produce the outgoing message with a *Time to live* (TTL) of 60 seconds:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. In the *JMS Config* window, for *Connection* select *Active MQ Connection*.
. In the *Consumer* tab, set the *Selector* field to `JMSType = `INVOICE` to filter incoming messages as invoice.

.JMS Connector Consumer Global Configuration
image::jms-global-configuration-consumer.png[In the Consumer tab, set the Selector field to filter incoming messages as invoice.]

. In the *Producer* tab, set the *Time to live* field to `60000` that defines the default time the message is in the broker before it expires and is discarded.

.JMS Connector Producer Global Configuration
image::jms-global-configuration-producer.png[In the Producer tab, set the Time to live field to define the default time the message is in the broker.]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:config>`,`selector` and `timeToLive` parameters configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection/>
  <jms:consumer-config selector="JMSType = `INVOICE`"/>
  <jms:producer-config timeToLive="60000"/>
</jms:config>
----

These properties can be overridden at operation level when required. In the following example, you need to publish a message with a shorter TTL, and to override the value of the *Time to live* field set on the global element follow these steps:

. In Studio, select the *Publish* operation from your flow.
. In the *Publish* configuration screen, scroll down to the *Publish Configuration* section.
. Set the *Time to live* field to `10000` to override the default global configuration previously set.

.JMS Connector Publish Configuration Override
image::jms-publish-configuration-1.png[In the Publish Configuration section, set the Time to Live field to override the default global configuration previously set.]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:publish>` and `timeToLive` parameters configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish config-ref="JMS_Config" timeToLive="10000"/>
----

[[configure-connection]]
== Configure the Connection to a Broker

To configure the connection in the global element, define the connection by either selecting *ActiveMQ Connection* or *Generic Connection*, set up the connection libraries and the JMS specification. JMS Connector also enables you to provide credentials if you require an authenticated connection, and also to configure connections caching to increase the performance of the application.

=== Configure an Active MQ Connection

JMS Connector supports ActiveMQ 5 by using the *ActiveMQ Connection*. With this connection, you can use both `JMS_1_1 (Default)` or `JMS_1_0_2b` specifications, and configure all the general connection parameters for JMS, as well as the custom parameters only present in ActiveMQ.

Once you declare the ActiveMQ connection, set up the *Connection Factory* with your custom configuration. Every parameter in the connection comes with a default value, meaning that you are required to configure only the parameters relevant for your use case. Also, the ActiveMQ connection exposes parameters that are exclusive of the ActiveMQ implementation, like **Initial redelivery delay*.

In the following example you configure an *ActiveMQ Connection*:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create*.
. In the filter box type `jms`, and select *JMS Config*.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Connection* field select *ActiveMQ Connection*.
. In the *Factory configuration* field select *Edit Inline*.
. Set the *Broker url* field to address of the broker to connect, for example `tcp://localhost:61616`.
. Click *OK*.

JMS Connector ActiveMQ Configuration
image::jms-activemq-configuration.png[ActiveMQ Connection Configuration.]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:active-mq-connection>` and `<jms:factory-configuration>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
 <jms:config name="JMS_Config">
  <jms:active-mq-connection >
   <jms:factory-configuration brokerUrl="tcp://localhost:61616" />
  </jms:active-mq-connection>
 </jms:config>
----

=== Configure a Generic Connection

Use the *Generic Connection* to configure a connection to any broker implementation. JMS Connector provides a JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) based connection factory builder that enables you to configure the connection using JNDI in the context of the application.

In the following example, you configure a *Generic Connection* to Artemis to use the `JMS_2_0` specification:

. In Studio, navigate to the *Global Elements* tab.
. Click *Create*.
. In the filter box type `jms`, and select *JMS Config*.
. Click *OK*.
. In the *Connection* field select *Generic Connection*.
. In the *Specification* field select *JMS_2_0*.
. In the *Connection factory* field select *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Connection factory jndi name* field to `ConnectionFactory`.
. In the *Lookup destination* field select any of the following options:
+
* *NEVER* +
 No lookup is done and the destinations are created using the existing JMS session.
* *TRY_ALWAYS* +
Tries to find the destination using JNDI, and in case it doesn't exist, create the destination using the current JMS session.
* *ALWAYS* +
If a queue or topic cannot be found via JNDI, fails with a `JMS:DESTINATION_NOT_FOUND` error.
+
[start=10]
. Select the *Name resolver builder* field.
. Set the *Jdni initial context factory* field to `org.apache.activemq.artemis.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory`.
. Set the *Jdni provider url* field to `tcp://localhost:61616?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false`.
. Set the *Provider properties* to *Edit inline*.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) to add a new provider property.
. In the *Provider property* window, set the *Key* field to `queue.jndi-queue-in` and the *Value* field to `in.queue`.
. Click *Finish*.
. Repeat step 14.
. Set the *Key* field to `topic.jndi-topic-in` and the *Value* field to `in.topic`.
. Click *OK*.

JMS Connector Generic Configuration
image::jms-generic-configuration.png[Generic Connection Configuration.]

In the XML editor, the `<jms:generic-connection>` and `<jms:jndi-connection-factory>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:config name="JMS_Config">
    <jms:generic-connection specification="JMS_2_0">
        <jms:connection-factory>
            <jms:jndi-connection-factory connectionFactoryJndiName="ConnectionFactory" lookupDestination="ALWAYS">
                <jms:name-resolver-builder
                        jndiInitialContextFactory="org.apache.activemq.artemis.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory"
                        jndiProviderUrl="tcp://localhost:61616?broker.persistent=false&amp;broker.useJmx=false">
                    <jms:provider-properties>
                        <jms:provider-property key="queue.jndi-queue-in" value="in.queue"/>
                        <jms:provider-property key="topic.jndi-topic-in" value="in.topic"/>
                    </jms:provider-properties>
                </jms:name-resolver-builder>
            </jms:jndi-connection-factory>
        </jms:connection-factory>
    </jms:generic-connection>
</jms:config>

=== Set Up the Connection Libraries

When you are configuring any connection type, you must always configure a library containing the JMS client implementation since JMS Connector is not bound to any particular implementation.

==== ActiveMQ External Libraries

For an ActiveMQ connection, there are three possible libraries that need to be configured depending on your connection settings:

* ActiveMQ JMS Client Library:

The `activemq-client` of your choice that provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory` implementation.

WARNING: This dependency is always required.

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
     <artifactId>activemq-client</artifactId>
     <version>5.14.4</version>
 </dependency>
----

* ActiveMQ Broker Library:

The `activemq-broker` is only required when using an in-memory broker based on the VM transport (which is the one configured by default). This dependency should provide a valid `org.apache.activemq.broker.Broker` implementation.

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-broker</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.4</version>
</dependency>
----

* ActiveMQ KahaDB Library:

The `activemq-kahadb-store` is only required when using an persistent in-memory broker based on the VM transport (such as, `+vm://localhost?broker.persistent=true+`).  This dependency provides a valid `org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.KahaDBPersistenceAdapter` implementation.

For example, you can use:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-kahadb-store</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.4</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Generic External Libraries

When using a `jms:generic-connection`, provide all the libraries that your ConnectionFactory and configuration of choice required. This will always depend on what are the implementations you choose, so be careful of adding all the dependencies to the application.

A common use case for this would be using the JMS 2.0 spec, thus you need a generic connection with a different client library, like Apache Artemis:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>artemis-jms-client-all</artifactId>
    <version>2.17.0</version>
</dependency>
----


=== Set the JMS Specification

=== Configure the Credentials for Authentication

=== Configure Connections Caching




[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If youâ€™re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If youâ€™re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the appâ€™s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.
