= Publish Messages and Consume Replies Using the JMS Connector Examples
:page-aliases: connectors::jms/jms-publish-consume.adoc

Anypoint Connector for JMS (JMS Connector) *Publish consume* operation enables you to publish a message to any specified destination, and then consume the message reply on a different specified destination. Request and reply is a very common pattern between applications.

When using this operation, the `JMSReplyTo` header of the outgoing message contains the ID of the destination on which your application waits to consume a response. The destination might be a well-known destination or a temporary destination created with the purpose of receiving a single response message.

Finally, the result of the operation is the message received as a response,
with the same structure as invoking the *Consume* operation.

== Receive a Reply On a Temporary Queue

To set a temporary queue, you configure the message being sent, and the operation automatically waits for a response.

In the following example, you configure the *Publish consume* operation to publish a message with the:

* Current `payload` as its body
* `JMSReplyTo` header configured to a temporary destination
* *Destination* field to `targetDestination`

Then, the operation automatically tries to consume the response from the temporary
queue until a message is consumed or the *Maximum wait* is reached, in which case
it fails with a `JMS:TIMEOUT` error:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish consume* operation.
. In the connector configuration screen, set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. Scroll down to the *Consume Configuration* section and set the *Maximum wait* field to `20`.
. Set the *Maximum wait unit* to `SECONDS`.

In the XML editor, the `destination` and `<jms:consume-configuration>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish-consume
doc:name="Publish consume"
config-ref="config"
destination="targetDestination">
	<jms:consume-configuration maximumWait="20" maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS" />
</jms:publish-consume>

== Receive a Reply On a Known Queue

To set a known queue for replies, configure the *Reply To* field on the outgoing message.

In the following example, you configure the *Publish consume* operation to publish a message to the `targetDestination` with the:

* Current `payload` as its body
* `JMSReplyTo` header configured to the known queue
* *Reply To* field to `replyToDestination`

Then, the operation automatically tries to consume the response from the known `replyToDestination` queue until a message is consumed or the *Maximum wait* is reached, in which case it fails with a `JMS:TIMEOUT` error:

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish consume* operation.
. In the connector configuration screen, set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. In the *Message* section, set the *Reply To* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Destination Name* field to `replyToDestination`.
. Scroll down to the *Consume Configuration* section and set the *Maximum wait* field to `20`,
. Set the *Maximum wait unit* to `SECONDS`.

.Known Queue configuration

In the XML editor, the `destination` and `<jms:reply-to>` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<jms:publish-consume config-ref="config" destination="targetDestination">
    <jms:message>
        <jms:reply-to destination="replyToDestination"/>
    </jms:message>
			<jms:consume-configuration maximumWait="20" maximumWaitUnit="SECONDS" />
</jms:publish-consume>

== Configure Request and Reply Patterns

In JMS, there are two well-known request and reply patterns to understand how request and reply messages are correlated. In the *Request-Reply Pattern* field of the operation, you can configure the *CORRELATION_ID (Default)* and *MESSAGE_ID* patterns. Both ensure that an incoming message is the correct reply for an outgoing message.
You can also configure the field to *NONE* to not use any of the patterns, and the consumer tries to consume from the reply queue without using any selector to correlate messages. This option is useful when working with temporal queues that ensure that the queue has only one message.

=== Configure the Correlation ID Pattern

The *CORRELATION_ID (Default)* pattern implies that the operation after publishing a message to the destination queue, consumes a message using a selector that expects a message with the same correlation ID that was used to publish the request message.

In the following example, in the first flow you configure the *Publish consume* operation to publish a message to the `targetDestination` with the:

* Current `payload` as its body
* `JMSReplyTo` header configured to the known queue
* *Reply To* field to `replyToDestination`
* *Request-Reply Pattern* field to *CORRELATION_ID (Default)* +

Then, in the second flow an *On New Message* source reads the published message and responds using the same correlation ID pattern. A *Logger* component, logs the message response. +
Back in the first flow, the *Publish consume* operation consumes the response received and then another *Logger* component, and logs the final message.

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish consume* operation.
. In the connector configuration screen, set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. Set the *Request-Reply Pattern* to *CORRELATION_ID (Default)*.
. In the *Message* section, set the *Reply To* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Destination Name* field to `replyToDestination`.
. Drag a *Logger* component to right of the Publish consume.
. Set the *Message* field to `Received message from 'replyToDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]`.
. Drag a JMS *On New Message* source below the first flow.
. Set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. Scroll down to the *Response* section, and set the *Request-Reply Pattern* to *CORRELATION_ID (Default)*.
. Drag another *Logger* component to right of *On New Message*.
. Set the *Message* field to `About to reply to 'targetDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]`.

In the XML editor, the `requestReplyPattern` configuration looks like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="publish-consume-correlation-id">
  <jms:publish-consume config-ref="config" destination="targetDestination" requestReplyPattern="CORRELATION_ID">
    <jms:message >
      <jms:reply-to destination="replyToDestination" />
    </jms:message>
  </jms:publish-consume>
  <logger message="Received message from 'replyToDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</flow>

<flow name="jms-listener-correlation-id" >
  <jms:listener config-ref="config" destination="targetDestination">
    <jms:response requestReplyPattern="CORRELATION_ID" />
  </jms:listener>
  <logger level="INFO" message="About to reply to 'targetDestination' with Correlation ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]"/>
</flow>
----

=== Configure the Message ID Pattern

The *MESSAGE_ID* pattern implies that the operation, after publishing a message to the destination queue, consumes a message using a selector that expects a message with a message ID of the same value as the message ID of the request message.

In the following example, in the first flow you configure the *Publish consume* operation to publish a message to the `targetDestination` with the:

* Current `payload` as its body
* `JMSReplyTo` header configured to the known queue
* *Reply To* field to `replyToDestination`
* *Request-Reply Pattern* field to *MESSAGE_ID*

Then, in the second flow an *On New Message* source reads the published message and responds using the same message ID pattern. A *Logger* component, logs the message response. +
Back in the first flow, the *Publish consume* operation consumes the response received and then another *Logger* component, and logs the final message.

. In your Studio flow, select the *Publish consume* operation.
. In the connector configuration screen, set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. Set the *Request-Reply Pattern* to *MESSAGE_ID*.
. In the *Message* section, set the *Reply To* field to *Edit inline*.
. Set the *Destination Name* field to `replyToDestination`.
. Drag a *Logger* component to right of the Publish consume.
. Set the *Message* field to `Received message from 'replyToDestination' with Message ID: #[attributes.headers.correlationId]`.
. Drag a JMS *On New Message* source below the first flow.
. Set the *Destination* field to `targetDestination`.
. Scroll down to the *Response* section, and set the *Request-Reply Pattern* to *MESSAGE_ID*.
. Drag another *Logger* component to right of *On New Message*.
. Set the *Message* field to `About to reply to 'targetDestination' with Message ID: #[attributes.headers.messageId]`.
