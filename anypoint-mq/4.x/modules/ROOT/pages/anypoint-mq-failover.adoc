= Using Cross-Region Failover

Anypoint MQ Connector for Mule 4 version 4.0.5 and later provides failover capability for standard queues.

This feature is not enabled by default.
Before using this feature, review xref:mq::mq-failover.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
When you enable failover for a queue and the primary region goes down,
your data resides in a different region.


To use the failover feature, do the following:

* In your app:

.. Upgrade Anypoint MQ Connector to version 4.0.5 or later.
.. <<enable-failover-feature,Enable failover in your app.>>
.. (Optional) <<configure-check-frequency,Change the check frequencies>>. 

* In Anypoint MQ:
.. Create or modify a queue and xref:mq::mq-failover.adoc#enable-failover[enable failover on the queue].

[[enable-failover-feature]]
== Enable Failover in Your App

To enable the failover feature in your app, set the `cross.region.failover.feature.enabled` system property to `true`.

To set this application property in Runtime Manager:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager* in the navigation menu.
. Deploy a new app or change the settings for a deployed app.
. On the *Properties* tab, specify values for the property:
+
image::mq::mq-set-properties-failover-enabled.png["Properties tab with failover properties specified"]

For more information, see: 

* xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-manage-props.adoc[Changing App Behavior with Properties on CloudHub 2.0]
* xref:cloudhub::cloudhub-manage-props.adoc[]

Alternatively, set the property in *Run Configurations* in Anypoint Studio.
For more information, see xref:mule-runtime::mule-app-properties-system.adoc[System Properties in Mule Apps] 



[[configure-check-frequency]]
== Configure the Frequency of Fallback Queue Checks

By default, Anypoint MQ Connector checks the fallback queue once per minute.
To change this behavior, set the following properties:

* `fallback.messages.status.check.interval.ms`
+
Specifies how often the connector checks the fallback queue for any messages received.
* `primary.region.status.check.interval.ms`
+
Specifies how often the connector checks that the primary region is up when processing from the fallback region.

To set these application properties in Runtime Manager:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and click *Runtime Manager* in the navigation menu.
. Deploy a new app or change the settings for a deployed app.
. On the *Properties* tab, specify values for the following properties (in seconds):
+
image::mq::mq-set-properties-failover.png["Properties tab with failover properties specified"]

For more information, see: 

* xref:cloudhub-2::ch2-manage-props.adoc[Changing App Behavior with Properties on CloudHub 2.0]
* xref:cloudhub::cloudhub-manage-props.adoc[]

Alternatively, set these properties in *Run Configurations* in Anypoint Studio.
For more information, see xref:mule-runtime::mule-app-properties-system.adoc[System Properties in Mule Apps] 

[[check-interval]]
=== Check Interval Considerations

To determine how to configure the application property values: 

* When publishing to the fallback region, you might experience latencies because every publish check if the primary region is up.
+
To reduce publish latency, set `fallback.messages.check.interval.ms` to be greater than the publisher trigger frequency. (what is this?)

* After switching back to the primary queue, the consumer checks the fallback queue for messages before checking the primary queue.
Even if the fallback queue has no messages, this check can result in latency.
+
To reduce consume or subscribe latency, set `fallback.messages.status.check.interval.ms` to be greater than the consume/subscribe trigger frequency. (what is this?)

* After switching back to the primary queue, if the fallback region is down, consuming experiences latencies because the consumer continues to check the fallback queue. 
This check can add a maximum of 60 seconds to time out.
+
To reduce consume latency when the primary queue is up but the fallback region is down, set `fallback.messages.status.check.interval.ms` to a larger value to reduce the frequency of checking the fallback queue.
+
NOTE: A large value might result in out-of-order messages because messages in fallback queue are not processed as frequently.

== Publish Flow with Failover Enabled

With failover enabled, the publish flow for messages is:

== Consume Flow with Failover Enabled

With failover enabled, the consume flow for messages is:
