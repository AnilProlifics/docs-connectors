= Slack Design Center Configuration - Mule 4

Design Center Flow Designer enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Flow Designer:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

== Configure the Input Source Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*, and click *Create*.
. Click *Go straight to canvas* to exit from *Let's get started*.
. Click on the Trigger card.
. Search for and select *HTTP Listener* or *Scheduler*.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger. For more information on field values, see the xref:slack-connector-reference.adoc[Slack Connector Reference - Mule 4].

== Configure the Slack Target Component

+
