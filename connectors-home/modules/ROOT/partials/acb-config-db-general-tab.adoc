| UI Field | Description
| Input Parameters | A map in which keys are the name of an input parameter to set on the JDBC prepared statement. Each parameter must be referenced in the SQL text using a colon prefix, for example, `where id = :myParamName`. The map's values contain the actual assignation for each parameter.
| SQL Query Text |Text of the SQL query to execute.

| UI Field | Description 
| Transactional action | The type of joining action that operations can take for transactions:

** ALWAYS_JOIN
** JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE (Default)
** NOT_SUPPORTED
| Query timeout | Indicates the minimum amount of time before the JDBC driver attempts to cancel a running statement. By default, no timeout (`0`) is used.
| Query timeout unit | Select the unit of time to use. The default is SECONDS.
| Fetch size | Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a `ResultSet`. This property is required when streaming is set to `true`, in which case a default value of `10` is used.
|Max rows | Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any `ResultSet` object generated by the message processor can contain for the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.
|Parameter types | Array of xref:database-documentation.adoc#ParameterType[ParameterType]. Use this parameter to optionally specify the type of (one or more) of the parameters in the query. If a value is provided, you're not required to reference all of the parameters. You can't reference a parameter that is not present in the input values. 
| Target Variable | Name of the variable that stores the operation's output. |  
| Target Value a| String |  Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable. 
| Error Mappings | This attribute is not currently enabled. 
|Reconnection Strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever].
