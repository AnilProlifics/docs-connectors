| UI Field | Description
| Input Parameters | A map in which keys are the name of an input parameter to set on the JDBC prepared statement. Each parameter must be referenced in the SQL text using a colon prefix, for example, `where id = :myParamName`. The map's values contain the actual assignation for each parameter.
| SQL Query Text |Text of the SQL query to execute.

| UI Field | Description 
| Transactional action | The type of joining action that operations can take for transactions:

** ALWAYS_JOIN
** JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE (Default)
** NOT_SUPPORTED
| Query timeout | Indicates the minimum amount of time before the JDBC driver attempts to cancel a running statement. By default, no timeout (`0`) is used.
| Query timeout unit | Select the unit of time to use. The default is SECONDS.
| Fetch size | Indicates how many rows to fetch from the database when rows are read from a `ResultSet`. This property is required when streaming is set to `true`, in which case a default value of `10` is used.
|Max rows | Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows that any `ResultSet` object generated by the message processor can contain for the given number. If the limit is exceeded, the excess rows are silently dropped.
|Parameter types | Array of xref:database-documentation.adoc#ParameterType[ParameterType]. Use this parameter to optionally specify the type of (one or more) of the parameters in the query. If a value is provided, you're not required to reference all of the parameters. You can't reference a parameter that is not present in the input values. 
| Target Variable | Name of the variable that stores the operation's output. |  
| Target Value a| String |  Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable. 
| Error Mappings | This attribute is not currently enabled. 
|Reconnection Strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:database-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever]. 

The following is an XML example of a standard reconnection strategy setting the count of reconnection attempts before failing to `5` and setting `failsDeployment` to true, which causes the application deployment to fail if the connection test fails. Because a frequency is not specified, the retry interval is the default of every 2000 ms:

[source,xml,linenums]

<db:config name="Database_Config" doc:name="Database Config" doc:id="79ae8d0f-e0af-4901-961d-b80befbf3f86" >
	<db:data-source-connection >
		<reconnection failsDeployment="true" >
           <reconnect count="5"/>
        </reconnection>
	</db:data-source-connection>
</db:config>

The following is an XML example of a reconnect forever strategy where the connector attempts to reconnect every 4000 ms for as long as the application runs:

        <reconnection failsDeployment="true">
            <reconnection>
                <reconnect-forever frequency="4000"/>
            </reconnection>
