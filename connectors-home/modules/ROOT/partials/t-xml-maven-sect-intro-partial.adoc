Although you can manually code a Mule app in XML, it is more efficient to use Anypoint Studio:

If you manually code a Mule runtime engine (Mule) app in XML, either from the Anypoint Studio XML editor or from a text editor, you can access the connector from your app by adding reference statements to both your XML Mule flow and the Apache Maven `pom.xml` file.

If you add the connector in Studio, Studio automatically populates the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and it also adds a dependency to the `pom.xml` file.
