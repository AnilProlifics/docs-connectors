Anypoint MQ Connector doesn't support this parameter.

// Prefetch mode disclaimers
// tag::mqPrefetchMode[]
Don't use `prefetch` mode in the following situations:

* Applications with long processing times that use the `maxConcurrency` attribute to limit concurrent processing.
+
These options can cause messages to remain in the buffer longer, which can result in the messages expiring and being sent back to the queue.
* When using FIFO queues
+
Because Anypoint MQ can't guarantee ordering when using `prefetch` mode, don't use it with FIFO queues.
+
Using `prefetch` mode for applications with long processing times can consume significant resources because Anypoint MQ monitors the ACK TTL for all messages in the local buffer and extends the TTL to avoid sending messages back to the queue.

// MQ IMMEDIATE mode app restart note
// tag::mqImmediateAppRestart[]
When using IMMEDIATE acknowledgment mode, any messages currently being processed might be lost if the application restarts.
