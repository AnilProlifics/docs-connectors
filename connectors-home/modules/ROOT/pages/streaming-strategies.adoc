= Streaming Strategies

Configure the way data streams are consumed in Mule apps.

== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, the buffer expands according to the `bufferSizeIncrement` attribute, with an upper limit of `maxInMemorySize.` |  |
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | How much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower will mean that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  |
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory the buffer can use. If the buffer uses more than that, a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value that is lower or equal to zero means there's no limit. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The size unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |

[[repeatable-file-store-stream]]
== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream can use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed, the content is buffered on disk. |  |
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The size unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |
