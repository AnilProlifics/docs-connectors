= Using Anypoint Code Builder to Configure a Connector

//This include works
include::reuse::partial$connectors/connectors-mule-apps.adoc[] 
In Anypoint Code Builder, both integrations and implementations are Mule applications.

To use Anypoint Code Builder (ACB) to configure a connector:

. Install Anypoint Code Builder xref:code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Getting Started with Anypoint Code Builder]
. Supply your authentication credentials to Anypoint Platform.
. Create an integration project.
. Create a flow.
. Add a connector to the flow. ACB includes built-in connectors and processors. See xref:code-builder::acb-components.adoc[ACB Component Reference].
. Configure a source (trigger) for the connector's flow.
. Configure the connector.

Connector XML tags start with a namespace followed by an operation, following the syntax `namespace:operation`, such as `<db:select/>` for a Select operation in Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector).

Follow these best practices when you configure a source and connector in ACB:

//I don't know if the same principles apply here
*  Configure an associated global element for the source and connector.
* Create a YAML file or properties file to contain your properties, and then reference the file from the configuration.
* Configure a reconnection strategy for the source and target connector.

== Supply Authentication Credentials to Anypoint Platform

//All of this is documented already if I can get the include to work.

== Configure a Source for the Connector

A source, or trigger, initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. Configure a source for the connector's flow, such as an HTTP Listener operation (HTTP Listener), Scheduler endpoint (Scheduler), or connector-specific source.

=== Use HTTP Listener as a Source

HTTP Listener listens for HTTP requests and triggers the associated flow when it receives them. To use HTTP Listener as a source:

. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
. In the Add Component panel, select *Connectors* > *HTTP*.
. In the HTTP panel, select *Listener*
+ 
The HTTP Listener is added to your flow canvas.
+
The configuration XML file now includes the XML for the HTTP Listener in the `<flow/>` element, for example:
+
[source,XML]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="" config-ref="" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="ojzfry" />

</flow>
----
+
. In the canvas, click *Listener*. 
+
The HTTP Listener configuration opens.
+
. In the *General* tab, set the *Path* field to the appropriate path.
+
You can also choose a configuration for the listener if you have one created. 
+
. On the *Advanced* tab, 

For more information about HTTP Listener, see the xref:http-connector::http-documentation.adoc[HTTP Connector Reference].

=== Use Scheduler as a Source

Use Scheduler to initiate a flow when a time-based condition is met. You can configure Scheduler to initiate a flow at a regular interval or you can use a more flexible cron expression. For example, you can use Scheduler to initiate a flow every five seconds, or you can set up a cron expression to initiate a flow at noon every day for one month.

To use Scheduler as a source:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for and select *Scheduler*:
+
.Select Scheduler to schedule when a flow is initiated
image::intro-config-studio-select-scheduler.png[Selecting Scheduler as a source]
+
. Drag *Scheduler* onto the canvas.
+
The following screenshot shows the default values for the scheduling strategy:
+
.Default values for the scheduling strategy
image::intro-config-studio-scheduler.png[Default values for the scheduling strategy]
+
. In the *Scheduling Strategy* field of the *Scheduler configuration* screen, select whether you want to use a fixed frequency or cron expression to initiate the flow:
* If you select *Fixed Frequency*, enter values for these fields:
+
** *Frequency*
+
The frequency at which the Scheduler initiates the flow, based on the time unit specified in the *Time unit* field
+
** *Start delay*
+
The amount of time to wait before initiating the flow for the first time after the app starts, based on the time unit specified in the *Time unit* field
+
** *Time unit*
+
The time unit for the values of *Frequency* and *Start Delay*
+
* If you select *Cron*, enter the cron expression in the *Expression* field and the time zone in the *Time Zone* field.
+
For the format and valid values for the *Time Zone* field, see the Javadoc for the Java TimeZone class.
+
. To configure metadata for the payload, variables, and attributes, select the *Metadata* tab and add the appropriate metadata.

For more information about Scheduler, see xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler Endpoint].

=== Use a Connector-Specific Source

If a connector has associated sources, you can use a connector-specific source to initiate the flow. Each connector source has a unique configuration.

For example, you can use Amazon SQS Receive Messages as a source for Amazon SQS Connector. This source initiates a flow each time the specified Amazon SQS queue receives a new message.

To configure a connector-specific source:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for the connector and select the source.
+
For example, search for *Amazon SQS* and select the *Receive Messages* source:
+
.Searching for the Amazon SQS Receive Messages source
image::intro-config-studio-select-specific.png[Amazon SQS Receive Messages source]
+
. Drag the source onto the canvas.
. In the configuration screen, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to add a global element for the source.
. Enter values for the required fields.
. On the *Advanced* tab for the global element, specify a reconnection strategy. For information, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[configureConnector]]
== Configure the Connector

To configure a connector in your Mule app, first configure a global element that can be used by all instances of that connector in the flow:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, search for the connector and select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the canvas to the right of the source.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to add a global element for connector.
. Specify the global element properties for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab in the global element properties, specify a reconnection strategy, if supported. For information, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration] and the reference guide for the connector.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

After you configure a global element, configure the other fields for the connector.

For information about configuring a specific connector, see the user guide and reference guide for that connector.
