= Using Anypoint Code Builder to Configure a Connector

Create a basic integration project in Anypoint Code Builder, add connectors and other components to your Mule application to process your business logic, and configure attributes. 

== Before You Begin

Before creating an integration project, you must:

* xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the Anypoint Code Builder web or desktop IDE.]
* Have credentials to access the connector's API.

To use connectors, you must be familiar with:

* The connectorâ€™s API
* Anypoint Connectors
* Mule runtime engine (Mule)

After you complete the prerequisites, you are ready to create an app and configure the connector by using Anypoint Code Builder.

== Creating a Configuration File

A configuration file is a YAML file that references other configurations and specifies values for your connector's properties. Define the configuration properties based on the environment that you are deploying your application to.

. In the *Explorer* view, right-click the *resources* folder (`src/main/resources`) and select *New File*.
. Name the file `config.yaml`.
. Populate your file with the connection properties for your connector, for example, your Salesforce, Gmail, and Slack configurations:
+
[source,YAML]
--
salesforce:
 username: "yourUserName"
 password: "yourPassword"
 token: "yourToken"

email:
 host: "smtp.gmail.com"
 username: "yourGmailEmail"
 password: "yourEmailAppPassword"

slack:
 token: "yourSlackToken"
--
. Navigate to your project XML, add a new line before the `</mule>` tag, type `configuration`, and select *mule:configurationProperties*:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::select-mule-config-properties-contacts-sync.png["List of components with an arrow pointing to the mule:configurationProperties component"]
. Scroll through the attributes and set the value of `file` to `config.yaml`:
+
[source,XML]
--
<configuration-properties file="config.yaml" doc:name="Configuration properties" />
--

=== Salesforce Connector Configuration Example

Use the values in your `config.yaml` file to connect Salesforce Connector to your Salesforce environment:

. In your project XML file, create a new line after the `<configuration-properties/>` element, type `salesforce`, and select *salesforce:sfdc-config*.
. Set the *name* field to `Salesforce-Config`.
. Create a new line, type `basic`, and select *Salesforce:Basic*.
. Configure the `username` and `password` properties to use your configuration file values:
+
[source,XML]
--
<salesforce:basic-connection username="${salesforce.username}" password="${salesforce.password}" securityToken="${salesforce.token}" />
--
+
[NOTE]
--
When you move your cursor over the `${salesforce.username}` and `${salesforce.password}` elements, Anypoint Code Builder shows the values from the configuration file.
--
. Click *Test Connection* for the `<salesforce:sfdc-config/>` element to verify your connection to Salesforce:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder::sync-api-sfdc-test-connection.png["Arrow pointing to the Test Connection option in the connection XML"]
+
Anypoint Code Builder returns a *Connection is valid* message.
+
If you get an error, verify the error message to troubleshoot further.


[[configure-trigger]]
== Configuring a Trigger for the Flow
// tag::acb-configure-source[]
A trigger (source) starts the flow when specified conditions are met. If a connector has its own associated sources, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. Each connector trigger has a unique configuration.

=== Using HTTP Listener as a Trigger

. Click the *Listener* component on the canvas.
. (Optional) Click the edit icon to change the name of the *Listener* component. 
. (Optional) If you created a configuration file for the connector, select it. 
. In the *General* tab, in the *Path* field, enter the relative path for the path set in the HTTP configuration element. See xref:http/http-listener-ref.adoc#configure-paths[Configure Paths]. 
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Allowed methods |To allow all HTTP methods (default), do not define this attribute. To restrict certain methods, specify all allowed HTTP methods, for example, `GET, POST`, as a comma-separated list.  | No
| Response streaming mode | Whether to use streaming when the response is sent. | No
| Output MIME type | MIME type of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Parameters | Appends a key-value pair for a reader property to the value of the Output MIME attribute. Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.  | No
| Output encoding | Encoding of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Streaming Strategy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<configuring-streaming-strategy>>. | No
|Primary node only |If selected, executes the *Listener* trigger on the primary node only when running in a cluster. | No
|Redelivery policy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy]. | No
|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect], xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
| Response |See xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#HttpResponseAttributes[HTTP Response Attributes]. | No
| Error Response | HTTP error response returns a status code for the error. | No
|Body | Body of the error message. | No
|Headers |Headers to include in the error message. | No
|Status code | Status code of the error response, for example, `500`. | No
|Reason phrase | Reason for the error, for example, `Gateway Timeout` or `Internal Server Error`. | No
|===

For details about the Listener configuration attributes, see xref:http/http-documentation.adoc#listenerConfig[Listener Configuration].

=== Using a Connector-Specific Trigger

If a connector has associated sources, you can use a connector-specific source to initiate the flow. Each connector source has a unique configuration.

For example, you can configure one of these triggers to use with Salesforce Connector:

* *On Deleted Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user deletes an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On Modified Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user modifies an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On New Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user creates a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *Replay channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur in the specified channel source trigger the flow.
+
* *Replay topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
+
* *Subscribe channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.
+
* *Subscribe topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.

[NOTE] 
A channel or topic must be published to Salesforce before a subscription to the channel can be created.

For example, to configure the *On New Object* source:

. Add the *On New Object* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On New Object* component on the canvas. 
. In the *General* tab, select the configuration file to use, and configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Object type | Salesforce object type. | Yes
|Triggers query |Query that filters the trigger results, for example, `Name='Filter'`. | No
|Since | Date in the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` format, for example, `2017-03-17 16:30:40`. If this field is empty, this source retrieves the selected objects from the time the Mule app started.| No
|Scheduling strategy |Triggers the flow's execution based on a time-based condition. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<use-scheduler-trigger>>.| Yes
|===

. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
| Primary node only |Executes the *On New Object* trigger only on the primary node when the app is running in a cluster if selected. | No
| Redelivery policy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy] | No
|Read timeout | How long the consumer waits for a response before it times out. | No
| Time unit a| Time unit for the Read timeout. Enumeration, one of:

* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS | No
|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:salesforce/salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect-forever[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
