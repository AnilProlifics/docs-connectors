[[configure-trigger]]
== Configure a Trigger for the Flow
// tag::acb-configure-source[]
A trigger (source) starts the flow when specified conditions are met. If a connector has its own associated sources, you can use a connector-specific trigger to initiate the flow. Each connector trigger has a unique configuration.

You can configure the following sources for this connector:

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-partial.adoc[tags=listener-scheduler-descriptions]

=== Use HTTP Listener as a Trigger

. Click the *Listener* component on the canvas.
. (Optional) Click the edit icon to change the name of the *Listener* component. 
. (Optional) If you created a configuration file for the connector, select it. 
. In the *General* tab, in the *Path* field, enter the relative path for the path set in the HTTP configuration element. See xref:http-connector::http-listener-ref.adoc#configure-paths[Configure Paths]. 
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Allowed methods |To allow all HTTP methods (default), do not define this attribute. To restrict certain methods, specify all allowed HTTP methods, for example, `GET, POST`, as a comma-separated list.  | No
| Response streaming mode | Defines whether or not to use streaming when the response is sent. | No
| Output MIME type | MIME type of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Parameters | Appends a key-value pair for a reader property to the value of the Output MIME attribute. Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.  | No
| Output encoding | Encoding of the payload that this component outputs. | No
|Streaming Strategy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<configuring-streaming-strategy>>. | No
|Primary node only |Select this option to execute the *Listener* trigger on the primary node only when running in a cluster. | No
|Redelivery policy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http-documentation.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy]. | No
|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect], xref:http-documentation.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
| Response |See xref:http-documentation.adoc#HttpResponseAttributes[HTTP Response Attributes]. | No
| Error Response | HTTP error response returns a status code for the error. | No
|Body | Body of the error message. | No
|Headers |Headers to include in the error message. | No
|Status code | Status code of the error response, for example, `500`. | No
|Reason phrase | Reason for the error, for example, `Gateway Timeout` or `Internal Server Error`. | No
|===

[[use-scheduler-trigger]]
=== Use Scheduler as a Trigger

=== Use a Connector-Specific Trigger

If a connector has associated sources, you can use a connector-specific source to initiate the flow. Each connector source has a unique configuration.

For example, you can configure one of these triggers to use with Salesforce Connector:

* *On Deleted Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user deletes an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On Modified Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user modifies an object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *On New Object*
+
Initiates your app when a Salesforce user creates a new object. Possible object types are `Contact`, `Lead`, `Account`, `Contracts`, `Opportunity`, or the name of a custom object.
+
* *Replay channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur in the specified channel source trigger the flow.
+
* *Replay topic listener*
+
Subscribes to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events and events stored by Salesforce within the 24-hour retention period. Events that occur on records in the specified topic trigger the flow.
+
* *Subscribe channel listener*
+
Subscribes to a streaming channel. This source provides channel-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.
+
* *Subscribe topic listener*
+
Subscribe to a topic. This source provides topic-related notification settings for new events that occur after you subscribe.

[NOTE] 
A channel or topic must be published to Salesforce before a subscription to the channel can be created.

For example, to configure the *On New Object* source:

. Add the *On New Object* component to the canvas.
. Click the *On New Object* component on the canvas. 
. In the *General* tab, select the configuration file to use, and configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Object type | Salesforce object type. | Yes
|Triggers query |Query used to filter the trigger results, for example, `Name='Filter'`. | No
|Since | Specify a date in the `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` format, for example, `2017-03-17 16:30:40`. If this field is empty, this source retrieves the selected objects from the time the Mule app started.| No
|Scheduling strategy |Triggers execution of the flow based on a time-based condition. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<scheduling-strategy>>.| Yes
|===

. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
| Primary node only |Select this option to execute the *On New Object* trigger only on the primary node when running in a cluster. | No
| Redelivery policy | This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#RedeliveryPolicy[Redelivery Policy] | No
|Read timeout | How long the consumer waits for a response before it times out. | No
| Time unit | Time unit for the Read timeout. Enumeration, one of:
+
* NANOSECONDS
* MICROSECONDS
* MILLISECONDS
* SECONDS
* MINUTES
* HOURS
* DAYS | No

|Reconnection strategy |This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See xref:salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect[Reconnect] and xref:salesforce-connector-reference.adoc#reconnect-forever[Reconnect Forever], and <<configuring-reconnection-strategy>>. | No
