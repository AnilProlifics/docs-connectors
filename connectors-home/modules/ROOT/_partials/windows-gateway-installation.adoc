//This is used in the Windows Gateway Services installation instructions for Mule 3.9 and Mule 4 latest version

To install Windows Gateway Services:

. https://repository-master.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/org/mule/modules/anypoint-windows-gateway-service/1.12.0/anypoint-windows-gateway-service-1.12.0.zip[Download the Windows Gateway Services installer]. 
. Unzip the software distribution.
. Double-click the `Anypoint-Windows-Gateway-Service.exe` file.
. Click *Options* to change the installation location, or click *Install* to start the installation.
. If you are not using the MSMQ or Windows Powershell connectors, skip this step. If you are planning to use the MSMQ or Windows PowerShell connectors along with the Windows Gateway Services, copy the Authentication Token that is shown during installation. This is used to configure the connection for those connectors in Studio. 
.. After you copy the token, click *Install*.
. After the installation completes, the installer gives you the option to view the `readme.txt` file, which has additional instructions.
. Click *Finish* to exit.
. The installation creates the new *Anypoint Gateway* Windows service, which the installer starts.
