= Salesforce CDP Connector 1.0 - Mule 4



Anypoint Connector for Salesforce CDP (Salesforce CDP Connector) provides customers a pipeline to send data from both non-Salesforce and Salesforce properties alike into Salesforce CDP.

This connector works with the Salesforce CDP Bulk and Streaming API, depending on the operation you configure. Each API call uses a request/response pattern over an HTTPS connection. All required request headers, error handling, and HTTPS connection configurations are built into the connector.
For information about compatibility and fixed issues, see the Salesforce CDP Connector Release Notes.
