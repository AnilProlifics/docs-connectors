[[configuring-trigger]]
== Configuring the Trigger For the Flow

A trigger (source) initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these triggers to use with File Connector:

* *On New or Upated File*
+
Triggers a flow for a newly created or modified file.
* *HTTP > Listener* 
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* 
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met.
+
See xref:anypoint-code-builder::acb-component-scheduler.adoc[].

For example, to configure the *On New or Updated* trigger:

. Add the *On New or Updated* operation to the canvas UI.
. Click the *On New or Updated* operation on the canvas UI. 
. In the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Directory |Directory where polled files are located. | No
|Recursive |Whether or not to use files contained in sub-directories. | No
|Matcher | Matcher used to filter events on files that don't meet the matcher's criteria. | No
| Watermark mode a|Select this option to pick only files that were created or updated after the last poll was executed. 

Options include:

* DISABLED
* MODIFIED_TIMESTAMP
* CREATED_TIMESTAMP | No
|Time between size check | Wait time in milliseconds between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. Mule runtime performs two size checks and waits the specified amount of time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. | No
|Time between size check unit | Time unit for *Time between size check*.| No
|Scheduling strategy | Triggers execution of the flow based on a time-based condition. This attribute is not currently enabled in the configuration UI. Configure it in the XML editor. See <<scheduling-strategy>>. | Yes 
3+| *Post processing action* 
|Auto delete | Select this option to delete each processed file after it is processed, which causes all files obtained in the next poll to be treated as new files. | No
|Move to directory | Enter the path to the directory to send each processed file to after it processed. This is an alternative to *Auto delete* if you don't want to delete the file.| No
|Rename to | This works in tandem with *Move to directory*. Enter a file name instead of a path. The connector retains the original file name if you don't configure this field. | No
|Apply post action when failed | This option is selected (true) by default. This determines whether to apply any of the post actions (*Auto delete* and *Move to directory*) in case file processing fails. If you de-select this option, no failed files are moved or deleted. | No
|Overwrite | Overwrites the target file when the destination file has the same name.| No

include::connectors::partial$acb-config-file-connector-partial.adoc[tag="advanced-tab-attributes"]

=== Configuring the Read Operation

The *Read* operation reads the content and metadata of a file at the specified path. The operation returns a message whose payload is an input stream containing the file's content. The metadata is represented as a `LocalFileAttributes` object that's placed as the message attributes (`Message#getAttributes()`).

A best effort is made to determine the MIME type of the file being read. The file's extension is used to make an educated guess on the file's MIME type. You can force the output encoding and MIME type with the *Output MIME type* and *Output encoding* optional parameters.

. Click the *Read* operation on the canvas UI to configure the following attributes in the *General* tab:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required

+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Lock | Select to place a file system-level lock on the file until the input stream the operation returns is closed or fully consumed. Be aware that the lock is provided by the host file system, so its behavior might change depending on the mounted drive and the operation system on which Mule runtime is running. | No
|Time between size check | Wait time in milliseconds between size checks to determine if a file is ready to read. This allows a file write to complete before processing. Mule runtime performs two size checks and waits the specified amount of time between calls. If both checks return the same value, the file is ready to read. | No
|Time between size check unit | Time unit for *Time between size check*.| No
| Output MIME type |MIME type of the payload this operation outputs. | No
