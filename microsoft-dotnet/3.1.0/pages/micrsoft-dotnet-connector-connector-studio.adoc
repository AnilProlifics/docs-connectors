= Use Studio to Configure .Net Connector - Mule 4

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the <link to the connector Reference Guide [<connector name> Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Anypoint Connector for Microsoft .NET to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `microsoft .net` in the search field.
. Click *<connector name>* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with .NET Connector:

* `HTTP Listener`, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* `Scheduler`, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure `HTTP Listener`, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP* > *Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `HTTP Listener` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify TLS information.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for <connector name>, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *<connector name* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, itâ€™s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target .NET system. .NET Connector supports.

To configure the global element for .Net Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, complete these fields:
+

+
* Scope: The scope of the module:
+
** Singleton: Shares the same instance of the .NET component across multiple calls. This is useful for storing a shared state in class instance members across different calls.
** Transient: Creates a new instance of the .NET component per request.
* Grant Full Trust to the assembly: .NET code can be executed in an application domain with restricted privileges to avoid the execution of malware code that can affect the stability of the Mule Runtime. These restrictions include limited access to the file system, native code execution, network calls, registry access, and more. By default the .NET connector is set to use full trust.
** Declared methods only: `true` is the default value.
** Include auto generated code: `false` is the default value.
+
. Navigate to the Assembly tab and select a connection type.
. Configure one of the following connection types:

* Resource
* External

=== Configure the Resource Connection Type

To configure the Resource connection type:
. In the *Connection* field, select `Resource`.
. In the *Path* field, specify the relative path to an executable .net library in the resource folder.
+
The default resources folder is src/main/resources.
+

Configure the External Connection Type

** For the External connection type - The Path field contains the full path to an executable .net library.
+
image::microsoft-dotnet-external-assembly.png[Studio External Assembly]
+
** For the GAC connection type - The Assembly Type field contains the fully qualified type name (for example,
`Namespace.ClassName`). This type of configuration is used with an assembly installed in the GAC (Global Assembly Cache).
+

== Configure the Legacy Connection Type

** For the Legacy connection type - The Assembly Type field contains the fully qualified type name (for example, `Namespace.ClassName`). The Assembly Path should contain Provide the path of the .NET assembly (for example, `C:\Projects\..dll`).
+

. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.


[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure the Other Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for <connector name>, configure the the other required fields for the connector:


//Use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration. For some connectors, you might also want to list important, non-required fields.

[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index
|===

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, configure the other fields for the connector. See xref:<connector-name>-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] for more configuration steps.
