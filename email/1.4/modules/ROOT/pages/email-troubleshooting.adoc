= Troubleshoot Email Connector - Mule 4

To troubleshoot Anypoint Connector for Email Connector, become familiar with the information about app logs, Javamail debugging, troubleshooting access attachments, troubleshooting protocols behaviours issues, and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

. If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.

. If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (log4j2.xml), you can also view the app log in the default location MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log.


== Enable JavaMail Debuging

You can enable JavaMail Debuging Loggin which is used by the underlying 3rd party classes. 


For that you must add `<property key="mail.debug" value="true"/>` on the IMAP/SMTP connection element. 
To enable Email logging:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/mule` path folder.
. Open your Mule app xml file inside the folder.
. Add `<property key="mail.debug" value="true"/>` on the IMAP/SMTP connection element. 

[source,xml,linenums]
----
  <email:imaps-connection host="..." user="..." password="..." >
    <email:properties >
      <email:property key="mail.debug" value="true" />
    </email:properties>
  </email:imaps-connection>
----

. Save your changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Navigate to the *Console* view to read the Email messages in the logger:

Example:
[source,plain-text]
----
DEBUG: JavaMail version 1.6.3
DEBUG: successfully loaded resource: /META-INF/javamail.default.address.map
DEBUG: getProvider() returning javax.mail.Provider[STORE,imap,com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore,Oracle]
DEBUG IMAP: mail.imap.fetchsize: 16384
DEBUG IMAP: mail.imap.ignorebodystructuresize: false
DEBUG IMAP: trying to connect to host "******", port 993, isSSL true
* OK The Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service is ready. [******]
A0 CAPABILITY
* CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=XOAUTH2 SASL-IR UIDPLUS MOVE ID UNSELECT CHILDREN IDLE NAMESPACE LITERAL+
A0 OK CAPABILITY completed.
...
----

The debug lines will be printed to standard output. Meaning, the console if the application is executed inside Studio, or the log file if you run the application in a standalone Mule Runtime.

== Enable Email Connector's Debug Logging

To begin troubleshooting Email Connector, you can enable debug logging to see the exact error messages and its trace.

To enable Email Connector's Debug logging:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application's project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. If the following line is already in the `log4j2.xml` file, uncomment it to enable it; otherwise, add it:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<AsyncLogger name="org.mule.extension.email" level="DEBUG" />
----
+
. Save your changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Navigate to the *Console* view to read the Email Connector's messages in the logger:

Example:
[source,plain-text]
----

== SMTPS and Gmail Connection Issues

The method that you use to troubleshoot SMTPS connection issues depends on whether or not your Gmail account uses two-factor authentication:

=== Two-factor authentication

If your account uses two-factor authentication value generate an app-specific password and use that instead of your normal password.
See https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833[Sign in Using App Password] for details. You do not need to enable *Less Secure Apps* in your Gmail account.

=== Password based authentication

If your Gmail account does not use two-factor authentication, set up and enable *Less Secure Apps* in your Gmail account, and if your password does not work, go to https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha[Allow Access to Your Google Account] and follow these steps:

. Enter your username and password.

. Enter the letters on the captcha screen.

. Return to your Mule app and rerun the flow.
