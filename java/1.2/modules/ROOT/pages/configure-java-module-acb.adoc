= Using the Java Module In Anypoint Code Builder

Use the Java module in your Anypoint Code Builder project to define Java code. To use Anypoint Code Builder to configure the Java module, create a basic integration project in Anypoint Code Builder, add connectors and other components to your Mule application to process your business logic, and then configure the attributes for the Java Module. 

== Before You Begin

Before creating an Anypoint Code Builder integration project, you must:

* xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the Anypoint Code Builder web or desktop IDE]
* Have credentials to access Anypoint Platform
* Ensure that the Visual Studio Code Extension Pack for Java is installed.

When you create your project, a `src/main/java and /src/test/java` folder is created.
