= Using the Java Module In Anypoint Code Builder

Use the Java module in your Anypoint Code Builder project to define custom Java code. To use Anypoint Code Builder to configure the Java module, create a basic integration project in Anypoint Code Builder, add connectors and other components to your Mule application to process your business logic, and then configure the attributes for the Java Module. 

== Before You Begin

Before creating an Anypoint Code Builder integration project, you must:

* xref:anypoint-code-builder::start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the Anypoint Code Builder web or desktop IDE]
* Have credentials to access Anypoint Platform
* Ensure that the Visual Studio Code Extension Pack for Java is installed.

include::connectors::partial$configure-acb-connectors-partial.adoc[tag="acb-create-integration-project"]

When you create a new Anypoint Code Builder project, `src/main/java` and `/src/test/java` folders are created. For existing projects, you can manually create this folder. 

== Creating a Java Class and Adding Methods

Create Java classes containing methods to use in your application flows. The classes you create in your project are not available to other projects in your Anypoint Code Builder workspace.

. In your Anypoint Code Builder project, create a new Java package under `src/main/java`.
. Create a new Java class, and add the implementation, for example:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
package com.me;

public class TaxCalculator {

    private Double percentBaseTax = 7.0;

    public Double calculateTax(Double price, Integer percentAdditionalTax) {
        return price * (this.percentBaseTax + percentAdditionalTax) / 100;
    }

    public Boolean isTaxFree(Double price) {
        if (price < 10) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
---- 

[[add-components]]
== Add Components to Your Project

Add components to your integration project to build a flow:

. In the *Explorer* view, open the XML file for your project if it's not already open.
. Select *Build a Flow* from the start card to create an empty flow:
+
image:connectors::acb-build-flow.png["Canvas UI with starting card with the option to start from scratch, build a flow, or build a subflow"]
+
. Change the name of the flow: 
.. Click *Flow*. 
.. Click the edit icon. 
+
image:connectors::acb-change-flow-name.png["Arrow pointing to the flow name edit pencil icon"]
+
.. Enter the flow name, and click the checkmark.

== Configuring the New Action

Create a new instance to call the constructors for the classes you create by using the *New* operation of the Java module.

To configure the attributes for *New* in the Anypoint Code Builder UI:

. Click the *New* component on the canvas.
. In the *General* tab:
.. Select the *Class* that contains the method to use.
.. Select the *Method* to use. 
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes: 
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
| Target variable | Name of the variable to assign the instance to. | No
| Target value | Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable. | No
| Error mappings | This attribute is not currently enabled in the UI. Set of error mappings. | No
|===
. Select the *Input/Output* tab to filter and view input and output data for the *Invoke* action.

After you add your instance, <<configuring-invoke,configure the *Invoke* action>>.

[[configuring-invoke]]
=== Configuring the Invoke Action

Invoke methods with the provided arguments in an instance. The identifier of the method to invoke includes the class and method names.

To configure the attributes for *Invoke* in the Anypoint Code Builder UI:

. Click the *Invoke* component on the canvas.
. In the *General* tab, configure the following attributes:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
|Instance | Instance on which the method is invoked | Yes
|Args | Argument used to invoke the method. | No
|Class | Represents the fully qualified name of the class containing the referenced method. | Yes
| Method | Represents the method signature containing the method name and its argument types. For example, for the method with signature, `public String log(String msg, boolean verbose)`, the identifier of the method is `log(String, boolean)`.| Yes
|===
. Select the *Advanced* tab to configure the following attributes: 
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| UI Field | Description | Required
| Output MIME type | MIME type of the payload this component outputs.| No
| Parameters | Appends a key-value pair for a reader property to the value of the Output MIME attribute. Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.| No
| Output encoding | Encoding of the payload this component outputs. | No
| Target variable | Name of the variable that stores the operation's output. | No
| Target value | Expression that evaluates the operation's output. The expression outcome is stored in the target variable. | No
| Error mappings | This attribute is not currently enabled in the UI. Set of error mappings. | No
|===
. Select the *Input/Output* tab to filter and view input and output data for the *Invoke* action.

[[configuring-invoke-static]]
=== Configuring the Invoke Static Action

Invoke static methods with the arguments you provide. 

To configure the attributes for *Invoke* in the Anypoint Code Builder UI:

. Click the *Invoke Static* component on the canvas.
. In the *General* tab:
.. Select the *Class* that contains the method to use.
.. Select the *Method* to use.
