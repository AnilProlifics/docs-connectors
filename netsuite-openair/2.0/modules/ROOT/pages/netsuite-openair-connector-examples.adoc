= NetSuite OpenAir 2.0 Examples - Mule 4

This example shows how to add, modify, read, and delete two customers by using the same request. This example contains five flows:

. The first flow configures a template for the input.
. The second flow adds two customers from the input.
. The third flow modifies customer information of the two customers.
. The fourth flow retrieves the modified customer information of the two customers.
. The fifth flow deletes the two customers. 

The following screenshot shows the flows in Anypoint Studio:

== Create the First Flow

The first flow configures an HTML template for the input to later use when adding, modifying, reading, and deleting the two customers. Configuring this flow involves creating a new Mule project, configuring the HTTP *Listener* source, and adding the *Parse Template* component.

=== Configure the HTTP Listener Source

Configure the HTTP *Listener* source to initiate a Mule flow when a call is made to the default path (`/`):

. Create a new Mule project in Studio.
. From the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP* and drag the *Listener* source to the canvas.
. In the properties window, click *+* next to the *Connector configuration* field to add a global element.
. In the *Name* field, enter `Listener` and accept the default values.

=== Add the Parse Template Component

Add the *Parse Template* component to create a template for an HTML form (`form.html`), which is located in the main resources folder. The example uses this form to later add, modify, read, and delete the two customers:

. From the *Mule Palette* view, select *Core* and drag the *Parse Template* component next to the *Listener* source.
. In the *Location* field, enter `form.html`.

== Create the Second Flow

The second flow adds the two customers from the customer name and company inputs.
