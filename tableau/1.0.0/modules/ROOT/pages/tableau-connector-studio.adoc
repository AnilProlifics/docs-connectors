= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure Tableau Connector  - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::tableau/tableau-connector-studio.adoc
:page-aliases: connectors::tableau/tableau-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:tableau-connector-reference.adoc[Tableau Connectr Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector: 

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.


[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Tableau Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and to add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `tableau` in the search field.
. Click *Tableau Connector* in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure a Source

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Tableau Connector:

* *HTTP Listener* +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* *Scheduler* +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an *HTTP Listener* source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
+
image::tableau-select-listener.png[HTTP Listener selected in Mule Palette view]
+
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* *General* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field, for example `/createDatasource`. +
The path string describes the relative path from the path set in the HTTP configuration. 
+
image::tableau-listener-general.png[General configuration fields for HTTP Listener]
+
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the *HTTP Listener* source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information such as *Protocol*, *Host*, *Port*.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Tableau Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Tableau* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas and to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Tableau system. Tableay Connector supports only Personal Access Token authentication type. 

To configure the global element for Tabelau Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, from *Connection*, specify following fields for the connection: 
* Tabelau Server URL - The base URL of your Tableau Server
* Personal Access Token Name - The name of the personal access token
* Personal Access Token Secret - The secret value of the personal access token
* Content URL - The relative path of the Tableau site to sign in to
* Add the required libraries either by adding a local library file or by adding a maven dependency.
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified Tableau server.
. Click *OK*.

The following image shows an example OAuth Username and Password configuration using property placeholder values:

== Run a Flow

. In Package Explorer, right-click your project's name and click *Run As* > *Mule Application*.
. Check the console to see when the application starts.
You should see messages such as these if no errors occur:

[[view-app-log]]

== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Next Step

After you configure a global element and connection information, see the
xref:tableau-connector-examples.adoc[Examples]
topic for more configuration information.
