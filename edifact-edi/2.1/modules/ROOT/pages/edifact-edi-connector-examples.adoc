= EDIFACT EDI - Examples - Mule 4
////
While each example differs, all connector examples should have the following components:
An introductory paragraph that states what the example depicts. This paragraph should explicitly state why the example is helpful to the audience, and it can provide other necessary contextual information.
A screenshot of each Studio flow that the user is creating
Step-by-step instructions for creating the example in Studio
The resulting XML that users can paste into the Studio XML editor. You must remove the  attributes from the XML before including it in the topic.
If the example contains multiple flows or is long and complex, break up the example into subsections that reflect logical chunks of functionality. For example, the Apache Kafka Connector Examples topic shows how to publish a message for Apache Kafka and then retrieve it. It has one subsection for each flow plus one for the XML:
Create the Producer Flow
Create the Consumer Flow
XML for Consuming and Publishing a Topic
The Amazon SQS Connector Examples topic also contains two flows: one for publishing an Amazon SQS topic and one for consuming the published topic. However, the first flow consists of many components. This topic breaks up the first flow into additional subsections:
Create a Flow to Send a Message
Add a Transform Message Component to Attach the Metadata
Add and Configure the SQS Send Message Operation
Add a Logger Component to Display the Response in the Mule Console
Obtain the Number of Messages in the Queue
Add a Logger to Display the Number in the Mule Console
Create a Flow to Receive Messages
Example Mule Application XML Code
If your Examples topic contains multiple examples, create a hyperlinked list of examples in the topic introduction, as shown in the Template for Creating Multiple Examples in One Examples Topic, or use the Template for Using Multiple Examples Topics.
////
// Put Examples here -- You may need to obtain these from the
// code repo /demo folder.
Template for a Single Example
// Use this template to include a single example in the Examples topic.
// For examples of this template, see Amazon SQS Connector Examples and Apache Kafka Connector Examples.
= Title for what example does
<Introductory text>
The following text can be in the same paragraph as the introductory text or in a separate paragraph, depending on the introductory paragraph length.
This example uses variables for some field values. You can either:
Replace the variables with their values in the code.
Provide the values for each variable in a properties file and then refer to that file from the connector configuration.
If you don’t know how to use a properties file, see Configuring Property Placeholders.
Use subsections, if needed, to show the configuration steps.
== Subsection 1
== Subsection 2
== Subsection 3
.
.
.
// Add these steps to the end of the numbered list:
. Save the project.
. Test the app by sending a <REST command> request to <url>.
== XML for EDIFACT Studio
Paste this code into the Studio XML editor to quickly load the flow for this example into your Mule app

The following flow can be loaded in the XML for a project.

== To Read and Validate EDIFACT EDI Messages

. To read an EDIFACT message, search the palette for EDIFACT EDI, and drag the EDIFACT Read operation into a flow.
. Go to the properties view, select the connector configuration you created above and select the Read operation. This operation reads any byte stream into the structure described by your EDIFACT schemas.

The EDIFACT module validates the message when it reads it in. Message validation includes checking the syntax and content of envelope segments UNB and UNZ as well as the actual messages in the message. Normally errors are both logged and accumulated and reported in CONTRL acknowledgment messages, and all accepted messages (whether error free or with non-fatal errors) are passed on for processing as part of the output message Map. Errors in reading the input data results in exceptions being thrown.

Error data entered in the receive data map uses the EdifactError class, a read-only JavaBean with the following properties:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Property |Description
|segment |The zero-based index within the input of the segment causing the error.
|fatal |Flag for a fatal error, meaning the associated message, group, or interchange was rejected as a result of the error.
|errorCode |EDIFACT syntax error code.
|errorText |Text description of the error.
|===

Error data is returned by the read operation as optional lists with the "Errors" key at both root level of the data structure and at the message level. At the message level, this list contains non-fatal errors encountered during the parsing of that message. At the root level, this list contains both interchange errors and fatal message errors.

== To Write EDIFACT EDI Messages

To write an outgoing message, search the palette for EDIFACT EDI and drag the EDIFACT Write operation into a flow. Construct an outgoing EDIFACT EDI message according to the structure as defined above for input to the write operation. If no fatal errors are found in the write operation the normal flow continues. Otherwise, an exception is thrown that describes the error.

== To Send Functional Acknowledgments

Sending generated functional acknowledgments (CONTRL messages) is the same as writing any other EDI message, except you set the transactions to the acknowledgments that were generated during the read operation.

For example:

image::edifact-edi-ack-flow.jpg[Ack Flow Diagram]

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<edifact-edi:read config-ref="EDIFACT_EDI__Configuration" doc:name="Read EDI Doc"/>
  ...
<dw:transform-message doc:name="Create Outgoing Acks Message">
    <dw:set-payload><![CDATA[%dw 1.0
%output application/java
---
{
	FunctionalAcksToSend: payload.FunctionalAcksGenerated
}]]></dw:set-payload>
</dw:transform-message>
<edifact-edi:write config-ref="EDIFACT_EDI__Configuration" doc:name="Send Acks"/>
----

The generated functional acknowledgments have interchange data set up for sending back to the sender of the original message, so you don't need to change anything in the transactions to do the send.
