= Use Anypoint Studio to Configure EDIFACT EDI Connector - Mule 4
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]
Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.
To add and configure a connector in Studio:
. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.
When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.
If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:edifact-edi-connector-reference.adoc[EDIFACT EDI Reference].
[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project
In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector:
. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.
[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project
Add EDIFACT EDI Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In the *Add Dependencies to Project* window, type `EDIFACT EDI` in the search field.
. Click EDIFACT EDI in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.
[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source
A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with EDIFACT EDI Connector:
////
If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source.
////
* <connector-specific input source>
* HTTP Listener +
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* Scheduler +
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met
////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the text shown below.
////

// Text for using HTTP Listener source
For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:
. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow
When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.
To add an operation for EDIFACT EDI Connector, follow these steps:
. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *EDIFACT EDI* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.
[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector
When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target EDIFACT EDI system. EDIFACT EDI Connector supports <mention the types of authorization the connector supports>.
To configure the global element for EDIFACT EDI Connector, follow these steps:
. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, On the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <link to authentication method config section>
* <link to authentication method config section>
////
The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.
////
+
You can reference a configuration file that contains ANT-style property placeholders (recommended), or you can enter your authorization credentials in the global configuration properties. For information about the benefits of using property placeholders and how to configure them, see xref:introduction/intro-connector-configuration-overview.adoc[Anypoint Connector Configuration].
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.
////
Example of wording for Basic authentication. This varies by connector.
[[basic_authentication]]

[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields
After you configure a global element for <connector name>, configure the the other required fields for the connector. The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.

////
Put these into tables
////

=== About the General Tab
////
image::edifact-edi-general.jpg[General tab properties]
////
Use the *General* tab to configure settings for reading and writing EDIFACT messages.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Schema definitions |Manually create or edit the list of schema definitions used for the message structures.
|Substitution character |Use to replace invalid characters in string data
|Separators usage |Whether to use specified values as defaults only for writes or reads
|Data element separator |The default data element separator character
|Component element separator |The default component element separator character
|Repetition separator |The default repetition separator character
|Segment terminator |The default segment terminator character
|Release character |The default release character

|===

=== About the Identity Tab

image::edifact-edi-identity.jpg[Identity tab properties]

The Identity tab lets you configure the Interchange Header (UNB) identifier values for you and your trading partner in the EDIFACT EDI connector configuration. All these values are optional. If any are configured, the values are verified when reading an input message and used as the defaults when writing an output message if no value is specified in the output data.

The values that can be set are the Interchange ID qualifier and Interchange ID for your Mule application and partner. The Mule values specify the Receiver fields (UNB3.1/UNB3.2) in a receive message, and populate the Sender fields (UNB2.1/UNB2.2) fields in a send message.

=== About the Parser Tab

image::edifact-edi-parser.jpg[Parser tab properties]

You can set the following options to control parser validation of receive messages if needed:

* Enforce minimum and maximum lengths for receive values.
* Enforce repetition count limits for receive values.
* Enforce valid characters for UNOA/UNOB syntax levels.
* Allow unknown segments in a message.
* Enforce segment order in a message.
* Allow segments marked as 'Unused' in a message.
* Enforce segment repetition count limits in a message.

Other parser options let you:

* Override character encoding for receive messages.
* Require unique Interchange Control References (UNB.5).
* Require globally unique Message Reference Numbers (UNH.1).
* Set the minimum number of days to store interchange and message numbers for checking uniqueness.

=== About the Writer Tab

image::edifact-edi-writer.jpg[Writer tab properties]

Settings for writing messages:

* Set character encoding used for writing messages. The encoding must be defined in EDIFACT syntax versions.
* Set syntax version (UNB1.2).
* Enable a line ending that's written between segments to make output more readable.
* Always send UNA service segment (normally only sent when using non-standard separator characters).
* Enforce valid characters for UNOA and UNOB syntax levels.
* Request acknowledgments for send interchanges using Acknowledgment Request field (UNB.9).
* Set a test indicator digit to be used on send interchanges (UNB.11).
* Whether to use supplied values for control-segment information such as control numbers.
* Whether to use the default output MIME type `application/plain` or the Edifact-specific alternative `application/edifact`.


Use a table like this one to describe the required fields for the connector configuration. For some connectors, you might also want to list important, nonrequired fields.
[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |Description
|Table name | Name of the table to create
|Attribute definitions | Attributes that describe the key schema for the table and its indexes
|Key schemas | Attributes compose the primary key for a table or index
|===
////
[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log
To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:
* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the app log output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log output is visible in your OS console.
Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`. You can configure the location of the log path in the app log file `log4j2.xml`.
