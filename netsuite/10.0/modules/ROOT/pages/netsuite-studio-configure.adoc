= Use Studio to Configure NetSuite Connector
:page-aliases: connectors::netsuite/netsuite-studio-configure.adoc, connectors::netsuite/netsuite-to-use-design-center.adoc

Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-input-source,Configure an input source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<conigure-other-fields,Configure the other connector fields>>.

If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see xref:netsuite/netsuite-connector-reference.adoc[Netsuite Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector: 

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to Your Mule Project

Add Netsuite Connector to your Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location and add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Netsuite` in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-input-source]]
== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these input sources to use with Netsuite:

* `HTTP Listener`, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
* `Scheduler`, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure HTTP Listener, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of `HTTP Listener` in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify connection information.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify TLS information.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specific server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you immediately define a specific operation for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Netsuite, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Netsuite* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the input source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, it’s best to configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials the connector uses to access the target Netsuite system. 

To configure the global element for Netsuite Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the name of the connector in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (+) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, select an authentication mechanism and configure it as described:
+
[%header,cols="30s,70a"]
|===
|Configuration |Description
|Login Authentication |Makes use of the SuiteTalk's login API call on the first request sent by the connector to establish a session with NetSuite.
|Request Based Authentication |Using this strategy, you can send user credentials in the SOAP header of each request instead of authenticating to NetSuite by invoking login.
|Single Sign-On Authentication |This is a token based authentication system that avoids the use of environment username and password. Here you supply a privateKey together with other information. The connector is then responsible for generating an authentication token and establishing a session with NetSuite via the `ssoLogin` API call on the first request.
|Token Authentication |Similar to Single Sign-On Login Authentication, this is a token based authentication system. However, instead of using a privateKey generated via openssl, this uses a consumer and token key/secret pairs which are established within the NetSuite environment.
|===
+
. Configure these fields according your selection:
.. Login Authentication

== Use Case: Call NetSuite RESTlet

This use case shows how to call RESTlets that are deployed in NetSuite instances.

By following these instructions, you can:

* Create a customer record.
* Retrieve a customer record.
* Delete a record.

=== Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Anypoint Studio 7.0.x
* Mule Runtime 4.0.x EE
* DataWeave 2.0
* Access to a NetSuite instance with credentials in the `mule-app.properties` file

=== Deploy a Script as a RESTlet

. Create a sample JavaScript script:
+
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// Get a standard NetSuite record
function getRecord(datain)
{
    return nlapiLoadRecord(datain.recordtype, datain.id);
    // for example, recordtype="customer", id="769"
}

// Create a standard NetSuite record

function createRecord(datain)
{
    var err = new Object();

    // Validate if mandatory record type is set in the request
    if (!datain.recordtype)
    {
        err.status = "failed";
        err.message= "missing recordtype";
        return err;
    }

    var record = nlapiCreateRecord(datain.recordtype);

    for (var fieldname in datain)
    {
      if (datain.hasOwnProperty(fieldname))
      {
        if (fieldname != 'recordtype' && fieldname != 'id')
        {
          var value = datain[fieldname];
            if (value && typeof value != 'object')
            // ignore other type of parameters
            {
              record.setFieldValue(fieldname, value);
            }
        }
      }
    }
    var recordId = nlapiSubmitRecord(record);
    nlapiLogExecution('DEBUG','id='+recordId);
    var nlobj = nlapiLoadRecord(datain.recordtype,recordId);
    return nlobj;
}

// Delete a standard NetSuite record
function deleteRecord(datain)
{
  nlapiDeleteRecord(datain.recordtype, datain.id);
  // for example: recordtype="customer", id="769"

}
----
