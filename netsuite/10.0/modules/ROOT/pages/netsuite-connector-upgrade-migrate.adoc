== Upgrade Steps

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with the `Updates Available` message.

Click the pop-up and follow the prompts to install the latest version.

You can also follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `NetSuite` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *NetSuite* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the NetSuite Connector dependency version is 10.0.0 in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

If you were using one of the authentication schemas that were removed, please change your configurations so that they use either *Request Based* or *Token* authentication. +
Also, make sure that your error handling is updated and works as expected, given the minor changes in error codes in this version of the connector. +
As for the operations and sources, please look at the table above. If your integration involves any of the affected components, make the necessary changes to comply with the new interfaces.
All DataWeave mappings that create objects for operation inputs must be updated, since the package of the exposed classes was changed to `com.mulesoft.connector.netsuite.extension.api`. The same goes for mappings that transform object outputs.

=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

=== Reverting the Upgrade

If you must revert to your previous version of NetSuite Connector, change the `mule-netsuite-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the projectâ€™s `pom.xml` to the previous version.
Additionally, revert any changes made in the operations to their previous state.
