== Supported Upgrade Paths

|===
|From Version | To Version
|9.3.0 |10.0.0
|===

== New Features and Changes in This Release

This release contains the following new features:

* These operations were added: 
** *Get Account Governance Info* 
** *Get Integration Governance Info* 


== Changed Functionality in This Release

This release contains the following changed functionality:

* The Login and SSO authentication types were removed. +
If your integration is based on these authentication types, you must migrate to a Request or Token-Based authentication type.
* Other nonfunctional changes were applied to the interface of the connector to make it more consistent with other Anypoint Connectors. +
This means that some of the operation calls in your existing application might not initially work until some minor migration tasks are performed.
* Unknown errors are now thrown as `ANY` rather than `UNKNOWN`. +
Consequently, error codes `DISPOSE_ERROR`, `MAPPING_ERROR`, `CANT_READ_FILE`, and `TRIGGER` are now considered `ERROR_FAULT` errors instead of `UNKNOWN`.
* The *Map SSO* operation was removed.
* All exposed classes have been moved from the `org.mule.module.netsuite.extension.api` package to the `com.mulesoft.connector.netsuite.extension.api` package.

[[changed_operations]]
== Changed Operations

The behavior of some operations has changed in NetSuite Connector 10.0.

The following operations no longer default to `payload`:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation | Parameter

| Change Email a| newEmail
| Change Password a| newPasword
| Get Data Center URLs a| accountId
| Get Async Result a| jobId
| Get Custom Record a| internalId 
|===

The following operations are now *primary content* and *content* parameters:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Operation | Parameter 
| Async Search a| content 
| Async Add List a| recordAttributes 
| Async Update List a| recordAttributes 
| Async Upsert List a| recordAttributes
| Update Invitee Status List a| inviteeStatuses 
| Get Posting Transaction Summary 
| Get Posting Transaction Summary 
| Add File a| attributes 
| Add Record a| attributes  
| Get Deleted Records a| deletedDate 
| Update Record a| attributes 
| Upsert Record a| attributes 
|===

[[changed_sources]]
== Changed Sources

The three message sources were renamed:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Source name |Old XML name | New XML name

| On New Object | `<netsuite:new-object-trigger` | `<netsuite:new-object-listener`
| On Modified Object |  `<netsuite:modified-trigger` | `<netsuite:modified-listener`
| On Deleted Object | `<netsuite:deleted-trigger` | `<netsuite:deleted-listener`
|===

== Upgrade Steps

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the connector:

. A small pop-up message appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with the `Updates Available` message.
. Click the pop-up message and follow the prompts to install the latest version.

You can also follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `netsuite` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *NetSuite* and click *Add*. +
Studio upgrades the connector automatically.
. Click *Finish*.
. In the `pom.xml` file for the Mule project, verify that the NetSuite Connector dependency version is `10.0.0`. 

== Additional Tasks

* If you were using one of the authentication schemas that were removed, you must change your configurations so that they use either *Request Based* or *Token* authentication. 
* You must verify that your error handling is updated and works as expected, given the minor changes in error codes in this version of the connector. 
* Refer to <<changed_operations,Changed Operations>> and <<changed_sources,Changed Sources>> for updated operations and sources. +
If your integration uses any of the affected operations and sources, make the necessary changes to comply with the new interfaces.
* All DataWeave mappings that create objects for operation inputs must be updated, since the package of the exposed classes was changed to `com.mulesoft.connector.netsuite.extension.api`. +
You must also update mappings that transform object outputs.

== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Revert the Upgrade

If you must revert to your previous version of NetSuite Connector, change the `mule-netsuite-connector` dependency version `10.0.0` in the projectâ€™s `pom.xml` to the previous version.
Additionally, revert any changes made in the operations to their previous state.
