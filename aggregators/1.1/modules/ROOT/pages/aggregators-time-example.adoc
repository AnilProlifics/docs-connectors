= Time-Based Aggregator Example - Mule 4

The Aggregators module *Time based aggregator* scope enables you to aggregate elements within a predefined time limit. The following example shows how to configure this scope to aggregate HTTP request calls within `5` seconds. The application uses DataWeave to set the payload of each call with a random ID number. When the aggregation reaches `5` seconds, an *Aggregator listener* source gets the list of elements and the application logs all the aggregated random ID numbers.

To test this example in your own environment, you must create the Mule application and test it with curl commands.


== Create the Mule Application

To create the Mule flow in Anypoint Studio:

. In *Mule Palette*, select *HTTP Listener* and drag it onto the canvas. +
The source initiates the flow by listening for incoming HTTP message attributes.
. In *Connector configuration*, select *HTTP_Listener_config*.
. Set *Path* to `/test`.
. Drag a *Transform message* component to the right of *Listener*.
. In the DataSense preview window of the *Transform message* component, add the following DataWeave expression, which sets to each HTTP request payload a `Source Name` as `"time-based"` and a `Source ID` as `random() as String`:

{

    "Source ID": (random() as String)
}

. Drag the *Time based aggregator* scope to the right of *Transform message*.
. Set *Name* to `timeBasedAggregator`.
. Set *Period* to `5`.
. Set *Period unit* to `SECONDS(Default)`.
. Set *Content* to `payload`, which is the expression that defines what to aggregate; in this case, the transformed HTTP requests.
. Drag a *Logger* component into the *Incremental aggregation* route.
. In the *Logger* configuration screen, set *Message* to `Doing incremental step.`
. Drag an *Aggregator listener* source below the first flow. +
This source listens to the previous defined time-based aggregator. Once the aggregator releases its elements, the listener is executed.
. Set *Aggregator name* to `timeBasedAggregator`.
. Drag a *Logger* component to the right of *Aggregator listener*
. Set *Message* to `Aggregation complete`.
. Drag another *Logger* component to the right of the previous added *Logger* component.
. Set *Message* to the following expression, which returns all the aggregated elements:

. Save the project.
. In *Package Explorer*, click *Run > Run As > Mule Application*.
. Test the app by sending the following curl command twice within `5` seconds: +
`curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/test`  +
This generates two HTTP requests for the *Time based aggregator* to process.
. Navigate to the *Console* view to read the logger message:

```
This example logger message shows that for each HTTP request, the *Logger* component in the *Incremental aggregator* route logs the message
`Doing incremental step.` After the `timeBasedAggregator` value that is referenced by the *Aggregator listener* source completes the incremental aggregations within `5` seconds, the listener is triggered with a list of all the elements. The subsequent *Logger* component logs the message `Aggregation complete`, and the second *Logger* component returns the aggregated payload elements, which are the random ID numbers:

```
{
  "Source Name": "time-based",
  "Source ID": "0.7095971146328517"
},
{
  "Source Name": "time-based",
  "Source ID": "0.6900116288202388"
}
```
