== Operations

[[CreateAccessSettingsWhite list]]
== Add one or more IPs to the white list
`<sendgrid:create-access-settings-white list>`


Adds one or more IP addresses to your IP white list.

When adding an IP to your white list, include the IP address in an array. You can white list one IP at a time, or you can white list multiple IPs at once. IP Access Management allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the User Interface or the API. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can add to your white list. It is possible to remove your own IP address from the white list, thus preventing yourself from accessing your account. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /access_settings/white list endpoint.

[[CreateContactdbSegments]]
== Create a segment
`<sendgrid:create-contactdb-segments>`

Creates a segment.

All recipients in your contactdb will be added or removed automatically depending on whether they match the criteria for this segment.

List Id:

* Send this to segment from an existing list.
* Don't send this in order to segment from your entire contactdb.

Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field you are segmenting:

* **Dates:** "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after)
* **Text:** "contains", "eq" (is - matches the full field), "ne" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value)
* **Numbers:** "eq", "lt", "gt"
* **Email Clicks and Opens:** "eq" (opened), "ne" (not opened)

Segment conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier* or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing the ID of a completed campaign.

Segments can contain multiple conditions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or".

The Contacts API helps you manage your marketing campaigns recipients.

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /contactdb/segments endpoint.

[[CreateWhitelabelDomains]]
== Authenticate a domain
`<sendgrid:create-whitelabel-domains>`


Creates a whitelabel for one of your domains. If you are creating a domain whitelabel for a subuser to use, you have two options: 

1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel. 

2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel. 

A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.

For more information on whitelabeling, see the https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html[SendGrid User Guide].

[[GetAsmGroups]]
== Retrieve information about multiple suppression groups
`<sendgrid:get-asm-groups>`


Retrieves information about multiple suppression groups. This endpoint will return information for each group ID that you include in your request. To add a group ID to your request, append `&amp;id=` followed by the group ID. Suppressions are a list of email addresses that will not receive content sent under a given group. Suppression groups, or unsubscribe groups, allow you to label a category of content that you regularly send. This gives your recipients the ability to opt out of a specific set of your email. For example, you might define a group for your transactional email, and one for your marketing email so that your users can continue receiving your transactional email without having to receive your marketing content. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /asm/groups endpoint.

[[GetWhitelabelLinksSubuser]]
== Retrieve a subusers branded link
`<sendgrid:get-whitelabel-links-subuser>`

Retrieves the associated link whitelabel for a subuser. Link whitelables can be associated with subusers from the parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's link whitelabels. To associate a link whitelabel, the parent account must first create a whitelabel and validate it. The parent can then associate that whitelabel with a subuser via the API or the Subuser Management page in the user interface. Email link whitelabels allow all of the click-tracked links you send in your emails to include the URL of your domain instead of sendgrid.net. This operation makes an HTTP GET request to the /whitelabel/links/subuser endpoint.

[[PatchSendersBySenderId]]
== Update a sender identity
`<sendgrid:patch-senders-by-sender-id>`

Updates a sender identity. Updates to `from.email` require re-verification. If your domain has been whitelabeled it will auto verify on creation. Otherwise, an email is sent to the `from.email`. Partial updates are allowed, but fields that are marked as "required" in the POST (create) endpoint must not be nil if that field is included in the PATCH request. This operation makes an HTTP PATCH request to the /senders/{sender_id} endpoint.
