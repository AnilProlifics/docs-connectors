== Operations

[[CreateAccessSettingsWhite list]]
== Add one or more IPs to the white list
`<sendgrid:create-access-settings-white list>`


Adds one or more IP addresses to your IP white list.

When adding an IP to your white list, include the IP address in an array. You can white list one IP at a time, or you can white list multiple IPs at once. IP Access Management allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the User Interface or the API. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can add to your white list. It is possible to remove your own IP address from the white list, thus preventing yourself from accessing your account. 

This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /access_settings/white list endpoint.

Valid operators for create and update depend on the type of the field you are segmenting: * **Dates:** "eq", "ne", "lt" (before), "gt" (after) * **Text:** "contains", "eq" (is - matches the full field), "ne" (is not - matches any field where the entire field is not the condition value) * **Numbers:** "eq", "lt", "gt" * **Email Clicks and Opens:** "eq" (opened), "ne" (not opened) Segment conditions using "eq" or "ne" for email clicks and opens should provide a "field" of either *clicks.campaign_identifier* or *opens.campaign_identifier*. The condition value should be a string containing the ID of a completed campaign. Segments may contain multiple condtions, joined by an "and" or "or" in the "and_or" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty "and_or", and subsequent conditions must all specify an "and_or". The Contacts API helps you manage your [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) recipients. For more information about segments in Marketing Campaigns, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html#-Create-a-Segment). This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /contactdb/segments endpoint

[[CreateWhitelabelDomains]]
== Authenticate a domain
`<sendgrid:create-whitelabel-domains>`


**This endpoint allows you to create a whitelabel for one of your domains.** If you are creating a domain whitelabel that you would like a subuser to use, you have two options: 1. Use the "username" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel. 2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel. A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the âviaâ or âsent on behalf ofâ message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record. For more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html) This operation makes an HTTP POST request to the /whitelabel/domains endpoint

[[CreateWhitelabelDomainsSubuserByDomainId]]
== Associate a authenticated domain with a given user
`<sendgrid:create-whitelabel-domains-subuser-by-domain-id>`


**This endpoint allows you to associate a specific domain whitelabel with a subuser.** A domain whitelabel allows you to remove the âviaâ or âsent on behalf ofâ message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record. Domain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.

[[DeleteSuppressionBlocks]]
== Delete blocks
`<sendgrid:delete-suppression-blocks>`


**This endpoint allows you to delete all email addresses on your blocks list.** There are two options for deleting blocked emails: 1. You can delete all blocked emails by setting `delete_all` to true in the request body. 2. You can delete some blocked emails by specifying the email addresses in an array in the request body. [Blocks](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/blocks.html) happen when your message was rejected for a reason related to the message, not the recipient address. This can happen when your mail server IP address has been added to a blacklist or blocked by an ISP, or if the message content is flagged by a filter on the receiving server. For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Suppressions/blocks.html). This operation makes an HTTP DELETE request to the /suppression/blocks endpoint

[[GetWhitelabelIps]]
== Retrieve all reverse DNS records
`<sendgrid:get-whitelabel-ips>`


**This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the IP whitelabels that have been createdy by this account.** You may include a search key by using the "ip" parameter. This enables you to perform a prefix search for a given IP segment (, for example "192."). A IP whitelabel consists of a subdomain and domain to use to generate a reverse DNS record for a given IP. Once SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP is generated.

[[RepeatableInMemoryStream]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The amount of memory that will be allocated to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can be fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which all these attributes are expressed |  |

[[RepeatableFileStoreStream]]
=== Repeatable File Store Stream

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| In Memory Size a| Number | Defines the maximum memory that the stream should use to keep data in memory. If more than that is consumed content on the disk is buffered. |  | 
| Buffer Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** BYTE
** KB
** MB
** GB | The unit in which maxInMemorySize is expressed |  |

[[RepeatableInMemoryIterable]]
=== Repeatable In Memory Iterable

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Initial Buffer Size a| Number | The number of instances to initially keep in memory to consume the stream and provide random access to it. If the stream contains more data than can fit into this buffer, then the buffer expands according to the bufferSizeIncrement attribute, with an upper limit of maxInMemorySize. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Buffer Size Increment a| Number | This is by how much the buffer size expands if it exceeds its initial size. Setting a value of zero or lower means that the buffer should not expand, meaning that a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised when the buffer gets full. Default value is 100 instances. |  | 
| Max Buffer Size a| Number | The maximum amount of memory to use. If more than that is used then a STREAM_MAXIMUM_SIZE_EXCEEDED error is raised. A value lower than or equal to zero means no limit. |  |
